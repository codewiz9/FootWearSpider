Wendell\rFedEx Trade Networks\r128 Dearborn St.\rBuffalo, NY 14207\r\rRE:\tThe tariff classification of footwear from China\r\rDear Ms. Wendell:\r\r\tIn your letter dated October 23, 2002, on behalf of Giftcraft Inc., you requested a tariff classification ruling.\r\r\tThe submitted sample item, identified as being from the “Wacky Trax” <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Stamp line, is a pair of open-toe, open-heel sandal-like footwear.  The item is intended for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, as you state, by children aged 5 to 12 years old, for beach/sand <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> as a strap-on sandal for bare feet, or even possibly for fun as a snow <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> strap-on bottom over boots (although the textile straps of the upper do not appear to be adjustable for fit over a boot).  This novelty sandal has an upper comprised of several 1-inch wide adjustable textile material straps at the heel that encircle the wearer’s ankle and a single 2-inch wide adjustable textile vamp strap at the front over the toes.  Both the front and the back set of upper straps have hook-and-loop closures and are secured into and under a flat rubber/plastic midsole that is shaped to resemble a 6-inch wide and 11-inch long webbed reptile <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  This stylized “lizard” <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> shaped sandal bottom also has a ¾-inch thick rubber/plastic outer sole which will contact the ground, that has been molded to the contours of a three toed animal/dinosaur, complete with scales and claws.  We agree with you that children will <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> this sandal for the novelty and the fun of leaving strange footprints behind in the sand and so it is not intended for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> on a continuous basis.  Nevertheless, this unusually shaped sandal is not merely an item of flimsy or toy-like construction intended only for amusement or play, but was designed to be comfortably worn as an item of footwear classifiable in Chapter 64, HTS.  \r\r\tThe applicable subheading for this sandal, identified as “Wacky Trax” will be 6402.19.35, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear, in which the upper’s external surface is predominately textile materials (excluding accessories or reinforcements); in which the outer sole’s external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not “athletic footwear”; which has open toes or open heels; and which is over 10% by weight of rubber and/or plastics.  The rate of duty will be 37.5% ad valorem.   \r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

Almost all that is visible covering the\rwearer's <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> when worn, laces and tongue excluded, are the top\rpart of the rubber sidewalls of the simultaneous molded bottom,\rand several substantial areas of nylon mesh and plastic coated\rleather.  The exposed nylon mesh is not part of a complete upper\rof nylon mesh, which is the norm in similar shoes, but several\rpatches of an unusually thin mesh cemented to a sturdy fabric \rwith a relatively fuzzy, napped surface.  The nylon fabric here\rthus seems to serve a simply decorative purpose.  The leather\rpieces are all stitched to this same fuzzy fabric.  The fuzzy\rfabric has its own lining inside it, covers the entire <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, is\rstitched to the underfoot in these slip-lasted constructed shoes,\rand is clearly the only possible base material of the \""upper\"".  \rAlthough it is an unusual upper since fuzziness is not the norm\rin the aesthetics of athletic footwear uppers and since none of\rits surface is visible in the finished shoe, we believe it must\rbe the \""upper\"" by the process of elimination so we consider the\rrubber sidewalls, the cemented-on nylon mesh, and the leather\rpieces all to be \""accessories or reinforcements\"". \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     We note that the \""Made in Indonesia\"" is on the part of the\rsewn in label which leaves it right at the sock line,in fact the\rlast two letters of \""Indonesia\"" are covered up by the removable\rinsole in one of the samples, and it is about two inches further\rforward inside the shoe compared to the top edge of the tongue.\rEven though this label also has the USA, JPN, EUR, UK shoe sizes,\rwhich is a general indication that the label is in a reasonably\r\""conspicuous\"" location, it is clear that the \""Made in Indonesia\""\rhere is not in a location which is as conspicuous as the nature\rof the article will allow.  Therefore, if imported as is, Customs \rshould refuse delivery of these shoes into USA commerce until\rremarked in a more conspicuous location, e.g., on the inside of\rthe top of the tongue.   \r\r     The applicable subheading for this style will be 6404.11.20,\rHarmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which\rprovides for  footwear, in which the upper's external surface is\rpredominately textile materials (Note that an accessory or\rreinforcement on top of another material is not part of the\rupper's external surface, but the material hidden underneath is);\rin which the outer sole's  external surface is predominately\rrubber and/or plastics; which is either \""sports footwear\"" or\rtennis, basketball, gym, or training shoes or the like; and in\rwhich the upper's external surface area is over 50% leather after\revery leather accessory and reinforcement  present is included as\rpart of the upper's external surface.

We presume the\r\""Grass Chaps\"", a sample of which was not provided, does not\rdiffer much (except possibly in size and/or styling features)\rfrom your \""Lawn Chaps\"" sample.   We believe this is so, since the\rbreakdown by value figures, which you do provide for both\rsamples, show only a slightly cheaper value for the textile\rcomponent of the \""Grass Chap\"", while remaining equal for all\rother components present.\r\r     The articles in question are designed to be worn by persons\rengaged in residential lawn care and to provide the wearer with\rprotection against flying debris and other accidents which might\roccur while working with lawn care equipment.   They provide\rprotection for the lower leg (shin) and ankle as well as the\rupper portion of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.   Both the \""Lawn Chaps\"" and \""Grass\rChaps\"" are constructed of man-made textile materials, either\rpolyester or nylon, and contain special high strength\r\""polycarbonate\"" plastic inserts, which are permanently sewn into\rthe articles and provide additional protection to the wearer.  \rBoth these items are attached to the leg with straps and buckles\rand may be worn over long pants or on bare legs with shorts.\r\r     It is our determination that each of the two items described\rabove constitutes a composite good and that each consists of both\ra textile and a plastic insert component.   Based on the\rsubmitted component value breakdown figures, which indicate that\rthe plastic \""insert\"" cost $1.53 compared with $1.04 for the nylon\rfabric or $0.92 for the polyester fabric in the \""Lawn Chaps\""\rlegging <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> ($1.53 for the plastic \""insert\"", $0.75 for the nylon\rfabric or $0.63 for the polyester fabric in the \""Grass Chaps\"")\rand on the primary purpose of wearing these items to provide\rimpact protection against flying debris, also mostly attributable\rto the plastic \""insert\"", we are of the opinion that the essential\rcharacter of both these items is not imparted by their textile\rcomponents.   \r\r     The applicable subheading for both the \""Lawn Chaps\"" and the\r\""Grass Chaps\"" leg <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> articles will be 6406.99.3060, Harmonized\rTariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for\rgaiters, leggings and similar articles, and parts thereof, which\rare not essentially of textile materials or wood, but which are\rof rubber and/or plastics relative to other materials.  The rate\rof duty will be 5.3 percent ad valorem.   \r\r     This ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177\rof the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r     A copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above\rshould be provided with the entry documents filed at the time\rthis merchandise is imported.

Maloney\rRode & Qualey\r295 Madison Avenue\rNew York, NY 10017\r\rRE:\tThe tariff classification of textile footwear from China.\r\rDear Mr. Maloney:\r\r\tIn your letter dated August 17, 2000, written on behalf of your client, Deckers Outdoor Corporation, you requested a tariff classification ruling.\r\r\tYou have submitted samples of what you state are hiking shoes, style names “Quest” in the man’s version and “Cassile” in the woman’s version, made up of mostly textile uppers and rubber outer soles.  You state the shoes possess a foxing-like band since the soles overlap the uppers to a significant extent over virtually the entire perimeter of the upper.  Both shoes are valued over $12.00 per pair.  \r\r\tYour inquiry concerns whether or not this type of shoe is considered “tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like” as defined in Additional U.S. Note 2, Chapter 64, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS).  You state that these shoes are not like athletic footwear and should be classified as hiking shoes.\r\r\tYou state that, although bearing a limited resemblance to certain types of athletic footwear, the subject footwear’s outer sole is significantly heavier and stiffer than would be found on athletic footwear.  You state the shoes are designed for hiking and are not designed to be used for running or other athletic contests involving fast footwork.  You also state that the footwear incorporates a molded nylon heel cup or stabilizer which will protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> during hiking activity, also the relatively heavy and stiff sole incorporates a deep lug pattern for added traction.\r\r\tAdditional U.S. Note 2, Chapter 64 (HTS), defines the term “tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like” as athletic footwear other than sports footwear (as defined in subheading note 1 to Chapter 64 (HTS)), whether or not principally used for such athletic games or purposes.  \r\r\tIn HQ 953882 dated September 24, 1993, Customs rejected the contention that certain hiking boots are classifiable as athletic footwear, citing certain conspicuous differences between hiking boots and athletic footwear and the like.  Specifically, the hikers featured:\r\ra “heel” stabilizer on the “in” side of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> which extends past the mid point of the shoe;\r\rStitched and cemented on, molded rubber heel and toe bumpers;\r\r\rOutersoles which are considerably heavier and stiffer (although substantially less so than the usual hiker) and which have a quite different design and spacing for the “studs”; and\r\rUppers which cover the ankle.\r\r\r\tIn HQ 955224 dated March 25, 1994, Customs agreed that certain off-road protective footwear qualified as “athletic footwear.”  Among the reasons presented supporting classification as “athletic footwear” was:\r\rThe footwear is constructed along the same general lines as athletic footwear.  The only real difference is the outersole which is somewhat heavier than some, but not all, jogging shoes.  It is no less flexible.\r\rThe footwear is light; it is not heavier than athletic footwear.  It is consistent with the weight of athletic footwear.\r\rThe footwear is designed for use in activities which require fast footwork and extensive running. \r\r Aside from the physical appearance, the identification of basketball shoes, tennis shoes, (i.e. court shoes), gym shoes and training shoes is generally dependent upon (but not limited to), the presence of certain construction features incorporated into the shoes.  These features include special arch supports, shock absorbers, lateral stabilizers and special traction soles, features that are evident in the “Quest” and “Cassile” shoes.  The only characteristics consistently evident in the cited rulings which differentiate “athletic” from other types of footwear in addition to materials and appearance, is the weight of the shoes and the flexibility of the outer soles enabling the wearer to participate in activities requiring fast footwork and running.  Styles “Quest” and “Cassile” are certainly lightweight and flexible enough to be used in athletic activities, whether or not they are principally used for such athletic games or purposes.  They are constructed along the same general lines as athletic shoes, secured by a lace-tie closure and rubber/plastic outer soles which overlap the upper and forms a foxing-like band similar to those found on many athletic shoes.  This type of sole provides the necessary traction and stability to participate competitively in athletic endeavors.  These shoes are not unusual for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> while participating in athletic activities.  In addition, the literature provided emphasizes the shoe’s dependable long <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and describes them as being lightweight. \r\r\tThe applicable subheading for styles “Quest” and “Cassile” will be 6404.11.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics and uppers of textile materials, which are athletic, having a foxing or foxing-like band applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper, valued over $12.00 per pair.  The rate of duty will be 20% ad valorem.   \r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

This sandal-type shoe consists of a molded rubber cupsole shell bottom component part with closed rubber toe and heel areas, which also includes a removable insole.  The rubber cupsole bottom portion also has 1-¼ inch high sidewalls and a separately attached rubber/plastic outer sole.  The unique feature of this unisex shoe is that it has an injection molded midsole with four separate 2-inch wide slotted openings cut out of it along its horizontal length.  Through these openings, an elasticized 2-inch wide textile strap is threaded and then wound around the sides and the top of the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.

You have submitted a sample of style 69142.  You state that the outer surface is composed of 87% polyester and 13% nylon terry cloth fabric.  The booties will be imported with a removable textile packet filled with 300 grams of buckwheat seed and 5 grams of lavender.  The packet can be heated and then inserted in a pocket located on the back of the bootie.  The booties are then placed over the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> to provide warmth and aromatherapy.  You opine that the item is excluded from heading 6405 Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), because Note 1(b) to Chapter 64 states that “this chapter does not cover footwear of textile material, without an outer sole glued, sewn or otherwise affixed or applied to the upper.\r\t\r\tThe submitted sample is a textile slipper that covers the ankle consisting of sewn together textile components, (i.e. upper panels and a separate textile panel on the walking surface).  The slipper has an elasticized component in the collar that keep it on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Generally, in order for an item to be classified as footwear in Chapter 64, it must have an outer sole that is a separate, identifiable component prior to its application to the upper.  In addition, the sole component must encompass the entire underfoot area and the complete article must not be designed for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> inside other footwear.  In this regard, Item 69142 satisfies these requirements for footwear classified in Chapter 64 (HTSUS). The textile slipper and the removable packet (including its contents) is a composite good, with the essential character imparted by the slipper.\r\rThe applicable subheading for “Super Soft Holiday Heated Booties.” style number 69142 will be 6405.20.90, which provides for other footwear with uppers of textile material, other.

The text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on World Wide Web at http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/.\r\rThe submitted sample is not marked with the country of origin.  Therefore, if imported as is, it will not meet the country of origin marking requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1304.

Also, there is a 3 inch diameter leather patch with rows of raised rubber traction darts, sewn on at the back of the heel.  The shoe has a predominately textile upper, with a stitched-on, 3/4 inch wide leather topline collar that incorporates four pairs of metal eyelets spaced around it to contain a functional leather lace, which, after being laced around the topline, passes through a single pair of metal eyelets on leather tabs across the wearers instep.  The lace allows for the tightening of the shoe on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  You state that the lace is \""functional\"".  We take it that more often than not, the lace will be tied and untied by the wearer.\r\r     You state in your letter that this item will be valued at  more than $12.00 per pair.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for this shoe will be 6404.19.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear, in which the upper's external surface is predominately textile materials; in which the outer sole's external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not \""athletic\"" footwear; in which the upper's external surface is still 50% or less leather even after every leather accessory or reinforcement present is included as part of the upper's external surface; which is not designed to be a protection against water, oil, or cold or inclement weather; which has neither open toes nor open heels and is not a slip-on; and which is valued, we presume, over $12.00 per pair.

P.C.  \rSixty-seven Broad Street\rNew York, N.Y.  10004 \r\rRE:  Boots, hiking;  Athletic footwear; T.D. 92-32; Additional\r     U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64 \r\rDear Mr Baskin:\r\r     In a letter dated March 11, 1993, to the Regional\rCommissioner of Customs in New York, on behalf of Hi-Tec Sports\rUSA, Inc., you inquired as to the tariff classification under the\rHarmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), of three\rhiking boots produced in Korea.  Your letter, together with the\rsamples and descriptive literature which were submitted for\rexamination, were forwarded to this office for a response.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The samples are designated as styles GT Max, GT Rugged and\rthe Yazoo.  The GT Max consists of a nylon mesh upper covered\rextensively with full grain nubuk overlays, a phylon midsole, and\ran all-terrain carbon rubber outer sole.  The footwear is an\rover-the-ankle style, features stitched toe bumpers, and weighs\r14.5 ounces in a men's size 8.\r\r     THe GT Rugged is comprised of a nylon upper that is covered\rextensively with nubuk overlays, an EVA midsole, and a carbon\rrubber, wrap-around outsole.  The footwear is an over-the-ankle\rstyle, features stitched toe bumpers, and weighs 13.5 ounces in a\rmen's size 8.\r\r     The Yazoo consists of a nylon mesh upper, which is more than\r50 percent covered with suede overlays, an EVA midsole, and a\rhigh traction carbon rubber outer sole,  It is a \""high-top\"" style\rof footwear featuring thickly padded ankles, moisture wicking\rlining, stitched toe bumpers, and trail stabilizers.  It weighs\r16 ounces in a men's size 8. \r\r\r                               -2-\r\r     You claim that these hiking shoes are classifiable under\rsubheading 6404.11.20, HTSUS, as footwear with outer soles or\rrubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of\rtextile materials, footwear with outer soles of rubber or\rplastics, sports footwear, tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym\rshoes, training shoes and the like, having uppers of which over\r50 percent of the external surface area (including any leather\raccessories or reinforcements such as those mentioned in note\r4(a) to this chapter) is leather.  The applicable rate of duty\rfor this provision is 10.5% ad valorem.      \r\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Does the language of Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64,\rHTSUS, expand the coverage of subheading 6404.11, HTSUS\r\r     Are the hiking boots considered \""athletic footwear\"" for\rpurposes of classification under subheading 6404.11.20, HTUS?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     The term \""tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes,\rtraining shoes and the like\"" appearing in subheading 6404.11,\rHTSUS, is defined by Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64, HTSUS,\rwhich reads as follows:\r\r     2.   For the purposes of this chapter, the term \""tennis\r          shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and\r          the like\"" covers athletic footwear other than sports\r          footwear (as defined in subheading note 1 above)\r          whether or not principally used for such athletic games\r          or purposes.\r\r     It is claimed that Customs erred in T.D. 92-32 by requiring\rthat the hiking/backpacking boots at issue therein be \""like\""\rtennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, and training shoes.\rThe reason assigned for this error is that by inserting\rAdditional U.S. Note 2 into Chapter 64, HTSUS, Congress expressly\rdescribed what the phrase \""tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym\rshoes, training shoes and the like should cover.  Consequently,\ran analysis of whether the hiking/backpacking boots were \""like\""\rtennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes and training shoes     \rshould have been an irrelevant consideration.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              -3- \r\r     You assert that \""[i]t is a 'well-settled rule of statutory\rconstruction that for the purpose of ascertaining the intention\rof Congress, the entire context of the statute must be considered\rand every effort made to give full force and effect to all\rlanguage contained therein.' . . . To say that a definition is\rrestricted by the terminology of the phrase it is defining is to\rrender the definition void, meaningless, and of no effect, for\rthe very purpose of inserting a definition into a statute is to\rensure that the defined phrase is interpreted in accordance with\rthe definition, regardless of what the terms in the phrase might\rotherwise imply. . . .\""\r\r     Additional Note 2 to Chapter 64, HTSUS, neither restricts\rnor expands upon the terminology of subheading 6404.11, HTSUS. \rThe U.S. Note  merely clarifies the distinction between sports\rfootwear and other athletic footwear.  Further, a fair reading of\rthe note reveals that its purpose was to clarify that it was not\rnecessary for Customs to determine the \""principal use\"" of each\rstyle imported as \""like\"" due presumably to the blurring of the\rlines between \""athletic\"" and casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> in athletic shoes,\r(e.g., \""athleisure\"" shoes).  \r\r     In T.D. 92-32 (16 Cust. Bull. 4), responding to the claim of\rimporters that the hiking/backing boot is classifiable as\rathletic footwear, Customs stated at page 18 the following:\r\r          In this instance the hiking/backpacking boot, although\r          used in the sport of backpacking, fails to qualify as\r          athletic footwear within subheading 6404.11 because it\r          is not \""like\"" tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym\r          shoes, and training shoes.  Specifically, hiking boots\r          are heavier than the listed exemplars of athletic\r          footwear.  This slows the wearer's running speed\r          substantially.  All the exemplars are used in sports\r          which require fast footwork or extensive running. \r          Additionally, the exemplars are not constructed so as\r          to protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against rough and rocky terrain as\r          are hiking boots.  For these reasons we conclude that\r          the hiking/backpacking boot is not classifiable under\r          subheading 6404.11, as claimed. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                               -4-\r\r     You also assert that the reasons stated above for not\rconsidering hiking boots as athletic footwear are incorrect for\rthe following reasons:  \r\r     1.   The hiking shoes in issue are no heavier than for\r          example, the average pair of a corresponding size of\r          basketball shoes.  In fact, the literature of the GT\r          Max and the GT Rugged specifically state that those\r          styles are \""[l]ightweight shoe[s] designed  with an\r          outsole ideal for mountain biking, short distance trail\r          running, or day hiking with lightweight pack.\""\r          (Emphasis added.)        \r\r     2.   Customs contended that all the exemplars were used in\r          sports requiring fast footwork or extensive running. \r          The sport of hiking requires fast footwork and/ or\r          running -- for example, to cross a hazardous path, to\r          leap across a gap or over a barrier, or to escape the\r          elements or potential danger.  Further, the active\r          hiker/backpacker will incorporate sporadic jogging-\r          like running (frequently between one-quarter to one-\r          half mile intervals) into their day-long hikes. \r\r     3.   If footwear had to be used in a sport requiring\r          extensive running or fast footwear, in order to fall\r          within the purview of \""like\"" footwear under subheading\r          6404.11, HTSUS, then footwear such as aerobic shoes\r          would be excluded from that provision.  However, the\r          sporting goods industry in the United States clearly\r          considered aerobic footwear and other footwear not\r          requiring extensive running (e.g., walking shoes) to\r          come within the footwear category known as athletic\r          footwear\r\r     4.   The claim by Customs that the exemplars are not\r          constructed so as to protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against rough and\r          rocky terrain is not correct.  These shoes have\r          characteristics such as carbon rubber outsoles, lugs on\r          outer soles, EVA midsoles, heel counters, heel\r          stabilizers, nylon mesh/leather uppers, removable sock\r          liners, padded heel tabs, padded collars, padded\r          tongues, lateral stabilizer straps, double toe foxings\r          and adjustable width lacings which protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>\r          against rough and rocky terrain. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              -5- \r\r     With respect to aerobic shoes, it should be noted those with\rtextile uppers and soles of rubber or plastics are classifiable\runder 6404.11, HTSUS, as \""athletic footwear.\""  However, 99\rpercent of imported aerobic shoes have leather or plastic uppers\rwhich require classification in heading 6402 or 6403, HTSUS,\rwhere the \""athletic \"" distinction does not appear.  Contrary to\ryour assertion, aerobics, particularly \""high-impact\"" aerobics\rrequire \""fast footwork\"" and \""extensive running\"" action, albeit   \rnormally in place.  Due to the need for high skid resistance, for\rprotection of the sides of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> during <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> sliding on a hard\rsurface, and for protection from the jarring heel impact when\rrunning in place or jumping, aerobic shoes are made like and look\rlike a hybrid of tennis shoes, basketball shoes and training\r(jogging) shoes.  We note that no \""low impact\"" aerobic shoes are\rsold.  \""Low-impactors\"" normally <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> regular aerobic shoes\rcapable of \""higher-impact\"" use or tennis or gym shoes.  They\rnever <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> any kind of hiking boot. \r\r     Taking the exemplars in subheading 6404.11, HTSUS, into\raccount and disregarding the treatment of aerobics, it is quite\robvious that the Hi-Tec Backpacking Series such as the \""Yazoo,\""\rwith, among other things, its distinct heel, its  upper extending \rway over the ankle, its very thick sole to protect against sharp\rrocks, and its steel shank, obviously does not belong in\rsubheading 6404.11, HTSUS.  \r\r      The General Terrain Series such as the GT Rugged and the GT\rMax are more problematic.  They are quite similar; the GT Max is\ra little heavier and more \""hikeish\"" than the GT Rugged.  Due to\rthe studs, they are clearly different from the \""hard surface\""\rathletics, i.e., tennis, basketball and gym shoes.  However, they\rare suitable for \""short distance trail running.\""  Therefore,\rthere are several similarities between these two and the subset\rof jogging shoes which are appropriate for use on unpaved\rsurfaces.   \r\r     Unlike the training shoes, these shoes have the following\rconspicuous differences:\r\r     1.   a \""heel\"" stabilizer which on the \""in\"" side of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>\r          extends past the mid point of the shoe; \r\r     2.   stitched and cemented on, molded rubber heel and toe\r          bumpers; \r      \r     3.   outersoles which are considerably heavier and stiffer\r          (although substantially less so than the usual hiker)\r          and which have a quite different design and spacing for\r          the \""studs;\"" and\r\r     4.   Uppers which cover the ankle. \r\r                              -6- \r\r     Based on the foregoing, it is our opinion that the above-\rlisted differences between the shoes in issue and the exemplars\rlisted in subheading 6404.11, HTSUS, prevents them from being\rconsidered \""like\"" those exemplars.  Consequently, styles GT Max,\rGT Rugged and Yazoo are classifiable under 6404.19, TSUS, which\rprovides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials,\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics, other.  \r\r     \r     Inasmuch as you have stated that you are interested only in\rthe \""athletic\"" issue, we have not gone beyond the six digit\rclassification.  To provide an eight digit classification, we\rwould need additional information (e.g., whether the shoes have\rprotective features).   \r      \rHOLDING: \r\r     The language of Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chaspter 64,\rHTSUS, does not expand the coverage of subheading 6404.11, HTSUS. \r\r     The GT Max, GTR Rugged and the Yazoo are not considered\r\""athletic footwear\"" for purposes of classification under\rsubheading 6404.11.20, HTSUS.  \r\r     The GT Max, GT Rugged and the Yazoo are classifiable udner\rsubheading 6404.19, HTSUS.\r\r \r                                   Sincerely, \r\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director \r                                   Commercial Rulings Division \r\r\r \r\r\u001A\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1993/953882.doc"",""id"":9520,""rulingNumber"":""953882"",""subject"":""Boots, hiking;  Athletic footwear; T.D. 92-32; Additional     U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1993-09-24T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6404.11.20""]}"

US, Inc., on June 22,\r1995, against your decision regarding the classification of\rwomen's espadrille shoes.  All entries were liquidated on March\r24, 1995.  Only samples of one of the subject styles, \""Carmen\"",\rwere provided to this office for examination.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The merchandise consists of two styles of women's espadrille\rshoes.  The first style, referenced style name \""Carmen\"", consists\rof a textile upper which features a closed toe and heel, a thick\rjute platform midsole and a rubber outer sole.  Two samples of\rthis style were submitted to this office, one style features a\rshort lace, and the second style features a much longer lace. \rThe shoe has ten metal eyelet holes situated near the top edges\rof the upper, which are spaced in a symmetrical pattern around\rthe circumference of the topline opening.  A 5/8 inch wide flat\rtextile lace is laced into the eyelets.  On the style with the\rlonger lace, after exiting the last pair of eyelets the ends are\rstill sufficiently long so that they can be wrapped and securely\rtied around the wearer's ankle.\r\r     The second style, referenced style name \""Lucy\"", is composed\rof a textile upper which features an open heel, a thick jute\rplatform midsole and a rubber outer sole.\r\r\r     The Protestant claims that style Carmen was improperly\rclassified by Customs in subheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: other:\rvalued over $6.50 but not over $12/pair.  The Protestant argues\rthat this classification is incorrect because the rubber on the\router sole merely serves as reinforcement to the jute midsole and\rthe lace strap serves only as an ornamental feature.  The\rProtestant further adds that when style Carmen was analyzed by\rthe independent laboratory, it measured only 8.8 percent by\rweight of rubber or plastic. \r\r     Similarly, the Protestant claims that style Lucy was\rimproperly classified by Customs in subheading 6404.19.35,\rHTSUSA, which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber,\rplastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile\rmaterials: footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics:\rother: footwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the\rslip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces\ror buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing except footwear of\rsubheading 6404.19.20 and except footwear having a foxing or\rfoxing-like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics\rapplied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper: other. \rThe Protestant argues that this classification is incorrect\rbecause when analyzed by an independent laboratory, the shoe\rmeasured only 9.9 percent by weight of rubber or plastic.  \r\r     Accordingly, the Protestant claims that both style Carmen\rand Lucy should be classified in subheading 6405.20.90, HTSUSA,\rwhich provides for other footwear: with uppers of textile\rmaterials: other.  In the alternative, classification is proposed\rin subheading 6404.19.30, HTSUSA, which provides for footwear\rwith outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition\rleather and uppers of textile materials: footwear with outer\rsoles of rubber or plastics: other: footwear with open toes or\ropen heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, the\rforegoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except\rfootwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or almost\rwholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and\roverlapping the upper: less than 10 percent by weight of rubber\ror plastics: other.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     What is the proper classification of the merchandise at\rissue?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff\rSchedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is in accordance\rwith the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 requires\rthat classification be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes.  Where goods\rcannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, the remaining\rGRI will be applied, in the order of their appearance.\r\r\r     Classification of goods under chapter 64, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for footwear, is determined by the materials that\rcomprise the outer soles and uppers.  Note 4(b) to that chapter\rprovides that:\r\r     The constituent material of the outer sole shall be taken to\r     be the material having the greatest surface area in contact\r     with the ground, no account being taken of accessories or\r     reinforcements such as spikes, bars, nails, protectors or\r     similar attachments.\r\r     The Protestant claims that both shoe styles have a jute\router sole merely reinforced with a layer of rubber; the rubber\rserves to \""reinforce the jute outer sole primarily at the toe,\rheel, and along its perimeter\"".  As further evidence that the\rrubber serves merely as reinforcement, the Protestant adds that\rwhen the identical merchandise is sold without the rubber\rreinforcement, exposing the jute outer sole, the subject footwear\ris considered to have outer soles of textile in accordance with\rNote 4(b).\r\r     Although Note 4(b) does provide as an exception to the outer\rsole having the greatest contact with the ground, any\r\""accessories or attachments\"", it similarly defines those terms. \rThe words \""accessories\"" and \""reinforcements\"" are followed by a\rlimited number of defining exemplars such as spikes, bars, nails,\rprotectors or similar attachments.  To conclude that by\rsimilitude an entire external surface layer of rubber soling is\rincluded within the meaning of \""similar attachments\"" is not only\runfounded but clearly contradicts the intended meaning of Note\r4(b).  Following the above cited chapter note, it is apparent\rthat rubber is the constituent material of the outer sole having\rthe greatest surface area in contact with the ground.  Although\rthere are several \""cut outs\"" where the jute is exposed, the jute\ris sunken relative to the rubber outer sole so that more rubber\rwill have contact with the ground.  See also HQ 088334 dated\rMarch 12, 1991.  Furthermore, to add that identical merchandise\rsold without the rubber reinforcement is considered to have outer\rsoles of textile gives further support to our position that the\rsubject merchandise has rubber outer soles.  Merchandise is\rclassified by Customs on a case by case basis.  Shoes such as\rthese, without rubber outer soles and which expose the existing\rjute midsoles would naturally be classified based on the textile\rmidsoles, which in this case would serve as outer soles.  Customs\rhas consistently classified this type of espadrille shoe with a\rjute platform midsole and a heat molded-on rubber <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> surface\rbottom as footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics.  See\re.g., HQ 953483, dated July 29, 1993.  As such, it is our opinion\rthat the subject merchandise has an outer sole of rubber.\r\r     Protestant also claims that the textile fashion lace or\rstrap on style Carmen merely serves as an ornamental fashion\rfeature which does not hold the shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer. \rIn support of this claim reference is made to HQ 073384, dated\rDecember 22, 1983 and HQ 801649, dated November 24, 1981.  In HQ\r073384, discussing a women's imitation moccasin style casual\rshoe, Customs determined that the sample shoe was of the slip-on\rtype because:\r\r\r\r     the lace is not a functional fastener noting that it is sewn\rdown where it passes through  both the plug and the collar. \r                              Moreover, we would call this a\r                              slip-on even if the lace were not\r                              sewn down because wearers of this\r                              type of footwear normally tie the\r                              lace once to fit the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, and then\r                              slip the shoe on and off without\r                              retying the lace.\r\r     Unlike the submitted shoe, the shoe of HQ 073384 featured a\rnon-functioning lace which had been sewn down where it passes\rthrough the collar and the eyelets in the plug.  Notwithstanding,\rthe shoe in question in HQ 073384 was not like the subject\respadrille shoe which encases the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> with a soft textile upper\rbut a more rigid moccasin style shoe.  Thus, the lace strap on\rthe moccasin could easily be tied once to fit the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> allowing\rthe moccasin to be slipped on and off without further use of the\rlace strap. The same could not be said for the subject\respadrille.  The lace strap functions to conform the shoe snugly\rto the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer.  Once this is done, although it might\rbe possible to slip the shoe off, it would be more difficult to\rslip it back on without the textile upper folding into itself\rwhen the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> enters the shoe.\r\r     In HQ 801649, discussing a canvas, mock toe, rolled sole\rwoman's casual shoe, Customs determined that the sample shoe was\rof the slip-on type because:\r\r     The lace can be tied and untied and by pulling on the lace\r     ends through the kiltie and by tightly tying them together\r     (to keep the kiltie from returning to its usual position)\r     the shoe can be made somewhat tighter around the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>. \r     However, the effect is limited and rather awkward so we\r     believe this will rarely be done, almost certainly not each\r     time the shoe is worn.  Therefore, despite the lace, we\r     consider this a slip-on shoe.\r     \r     Although the shoe of HQ 801649 has a lace strap which allows\rthe ends to be tied together to make the shoe tighter around the\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, the ruling states that its effects are limited and awkward. \rTherefore, the presumption is that this unnecessary task will be\roften, if not always, skipped when putting on the shoe. As was\rdiscussed above, the design of the subject shoe does not\rfacilitate this option.  The subject espadrille features a lace\rstrap which is not only functional, but would render the ability\rto put on the shoe difficult without the use of the lace strap. \rThe shoe would easily collapse under the weight of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of\rthe wearer if the lace ends were not consistently readjusted\revery time the shoe was worn, regardless of their length.  Thus,\ralthough the long lace may have been designed to be wrapped\raround the ankle merely for its ornamental appeal, the design of\rthe shoe requires that the lace be passed around the wearer's\rankle and tied to hold the shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Additionally, it\rshould be noted that contrary to the Protestant's assertion that\rthe shoe stays securely on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> even without the use of the\rlace strap, when the submitted shoe was worn by someone in this\roffice without the use of the lace strap, the shoe slipped off\rthe wearer's <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Accordingly, as it is our position that the\rsubmitted sample is not of the slip-on type and that it has a\rrubber/plastic outer sole, the shoe does not qualify for\rclassification within subheadings 6404.19.25 through 6404.19.35,\rHTSUSA, where the breakdown of percentage by weight of\rrubber/plastic is of relevance.\r\r\r     In regard to percentage by weight of rubber/plastic for\rstyle Lucy, the Protestant disputes the findings of the Customs\rlaboratory which determined style Lucy  to be 10.2 percent by\rweight of rubber/plastic.  The Protestant submitted a report\rprepared by an independent laboratory which determined style Lucy\rto be 9.9 percent by weight of rubber/plastic.  The fact that an\rindependent laboratory determined a different result from that of\rthe Customs laboratory does not change Custom's decision.  The\rfindings of the Customs laboratory will take priority over an\rindependent laboratory result.\r\r     As such, the subject espadrille shoes, referenced style\rnames \""Carmen\"" and \""Lucy\"", were correctly classified in\rsubheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA, and subheading 6404.19.35, HTSUSA,\rrespectively.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     Style name \""Carmen\"" is classified in subheading 6404.19.80,\rHTSUSA, which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber,\rplastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile\rmaterials: footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics:\rother: other: valued over $6.50 but not over $12/pair.  The\rapplicable rate of duty is 90 cents/pr. plus 20 percent ad\rvalorem.\r\r     Style name \""Lucy\"" is classified in subheading 6404.19.35,\rHTSUSA, which provides for\rfootwear with outer soles or rubber, plastics, leather or\rcomposition leather and uppers of textile materials: footwear\rwith outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: footwear with open\rtoes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to\rthe <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners,\rthe foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except\rfootwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or almost\rwholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and\roverlapping the upper: other.  The applicable rate of duty is\r37.5 percent ad valorem.\r\r     The protest should be denied in full and a copy of this\rruling should be appended to the CF 19 Notice of Action to\rsatisfy the notice requirement of section 174.30(a) Customs\rRegulations.\r\r     In accordance with Section 3(A)(11)(b) of Customs Directive\r099 3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject: Revised Protest\rDirective, this decision should be mailed by your office to the\rProtestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter. \rAny reliquidation of the entry in accordance with the decision\rmust be accomplished prior to mailing of the decision.

The protest is against U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) classification and liquidation of the Instride® Advantage™ Dual Purpose Ankle <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Gauntlet under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).\r\rFACTS:\r\r\tThe merchandise that is the subject of this protest is identified as the Instride® Ankle <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Gauntlet.  It consists of a textile (neoprene) upper that covers the wearer’s forefoot, ankle, and toes.  The separately applied outer sole is constructed from the same textile/neoprene material but it is covered with a rubber/plastic application.  CBP Laboratory and Scientific Services Report Number NY20051854, dated March 22, 2006, indicates that the product consists of 61.3% textile materials and 38.7% rubber or plastic materials.  The product is secured to the user’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by a Velcro™ connection around the ankle.  The heel is completely open.  A picture of the merchandise follows. \u0002\r\r\u0001\r\r\tThe protestant made six entries of the subject merchandise through your port between May 13, 2005 and December 10, 2005 under heading 6115, HTSUS, which provides for footwear without applied soles, stockings and other hosiery, including those for varicose veins.  On August 24, 2006, you issued a Request for Information (CBP Form 28) requesting that the importer submit written information from a prior meeting along with other procedural information.  The entries were liquidated on June 30, 2006 and July 7, 2006 under heading 6404, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles of leather, plastics, or rubber and uppers of textiles.  The protestant then filed a protest on these six entries on August 9, 2006, arguing for classification in heading 6307, HTSUS, which provides for other made-up articles of textiles.\r\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhether the subject merchandise is classifiable in heading 6307, HTSUS, as other made up articles of textiles or as footwear in heading 6404, HTSUS, as footwear with uppers of textiles and outer soles of plastic or rubber?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tInitially, we note that this matter is protestable as a classification decision pursuant to 19 U.S.C. §1514(a)(2).  The protest was timely filed on August 9, 2006, within 180 days of the liquidation of the first entry giving rise to the protest.  See Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2004, Pub.L. 108-429, §2103(2)(B)(ii),(iii) (codified as amended at 19 U.S.C. §1514(c)(3) (2006)).  \r\r\tFurther review of Protest 4701-06-100549 was properly accorded because the port’s decision is alleged to be inconsistent with a ruling on the same or substantially similar merchandise.  See 19 C.F.R. §174.24(a).  Specifically, the protestant cites New York Ruling Letter (NY) K89724, dated September 30, 2004; NY L80096, dated October 12, 2004; and NY L85138, dated May 26, 2005, which classified various ankle support products in heading 6307, HTSUS.\r\r\tClassification under the HTSUS is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 may then be applied in order.  \r\r\tThe 2005 HTSUS provisions under consideration are:\r\r6307\tOther made up articles, including dress patterns:\r\r6404\tFootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\r\r\tChapter 64, Note 1, HTSUS, provides in relevant part (emphasis added):\r\r\tThis chapter does not cover:\r\r(b)\tFootwear of textile material, without an outer sole glued, sewn or otherwise affixed or applied to the upper (section XI)\r\rChapter 64, Note 4, HTSUS, provides in relevant part:\r\rSubject to note 3 to this chapter:\r\r(b)\tThe constituent material of the outer sole shall be taken to be the material having the greatest surface area in contact with the ground, no account being taken of accessories or reinforcements such as spikes, bars, nails, protectors or similar attachments.\r\r\tThe term “outer sole” is defined in the Explanatory Note (EN) to Section XII (which includes heading 6404, HTSUS).\u0002  EN (C) provides:  “[t]he term ‘outer sole’ as used in headings 64.01 to 64.05 means that part of the footwear (other than an attached heel) which, when in use, is in contact with the ground.”  \r\r\tCBP has determined that the test on whether or not a product has an outer sole that has been affixed to the product is whether or not there is a “line of demarcation” between the upper and the outer sole such that the outer sole is a completely separate component prior to its application to the upper.  See Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 967659, dated July 1, 2005; HQ 967851, dated November 18, 2005; and HQ 956921, dated November 22, 1994.  In particular the “line of demarcation” has been defined as “the line along which the sole ends and the upper begins.”  See Treasury Decision (T.D.) 93-88 (27 Cust. Bull. & Dec. 46), dated October 25, 1993.  In addition, the product must not be designed to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> inside other footwear.  Id.\r\r\tApplying these definitions to the present merchandise, the product consists of two pieces of material that are sewn together with a strip of material covering the seam.  The seam is located on the edges where the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> would touch the ground.  In addition, this office was able to completely unstitch the piece of material that would come in contact with the ground.  We believe that this product does have a line of demarcation indicating there is a separate piece of textile material that touches the ground.  The seam is the line of demarcation and the ability to separate the two components is a clear indication that there is a separately applied outer sole.  The separate piece of material is the outer sole of the footwear because this piece of material is the portion of the product that will come in contact with the ground.  Thus, this product cannot be excluded from classification in Chapter 64, HTSUS, because it has a separately applied outer sole.  Furthermore, the plastic is the material having the greatest surface area in contact with the ground because the applied outer sole is completely covered in plastic.  Therefore, classification in heading 6404, HTSUS, is appropriate.\r\r\tFinally, in your submission you contend that the product is similar to the products in New York Ruling Letters (NY) K89724, dated September 30, 2004; L80096, dated October 12, 2004; and L85138, dated May 26, 2005.  The product that was the subject of NY L85138 was a textile ankle wrap that was a single piece of textile material that the user simply wrapped around their ankle.  In response to this protest, this office, requested and reviewed the files for NY K89724 and L80096 to determine if the products were substantially similar to the product that is the subject of this protest.  Based on our review of both of these files we are unable to determine whether or not this product is substantially similar to the product before us.  Since we are unable to determine whether or not these rulings describe substantially similar products we believe that the protestant cannot rely on these rulings when classifying its merchandise.  Thus, none of these rulings are controlling in this case.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tBy application of GRI 1, the Instride Ankle <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Gauntlet is classified in heading 6404, HTSUS, more specifically, it is classified in subheading 6404.19.3580, HTSUSA, which provides for “[f]ootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: [o]ther: [f]ootwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> having a foxing or foxing like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper: [o]ther… [o]ther: [o]ther…”  The 2005 column one, general rate of duty, is 37.5% ad valorem. \r\rYou are instructed to DENY the protest.  In accordance with Sections IV and VI of the CBP Protest/Petition Processing Handbook (HB 3500-08A, December 2007, pp. 24 and 26), you are to mail this decision, together with the CBP Form 19, to the protestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter.  Any reliquidation of the entry or entries in accordance with the decision must be accomplished prior to mailing the decision.\r\rSixty days from the date of the decision, the Office International Trade, Regulations and Rulings, will make the decision available to CBP personnel, and to the public on the CBP Home Page on the World Wide Web at www.CBP.gov, by means of the Freedom of Information Act, and other methods of public distribution.\r\r\r\tSincerely,\r\r\r\r\r\tMyles B.

Orvis Sandals, Style OR3-039, Stock names “Manatee”(men’s) and “Tula” (women’s) - An open-toe, open-heel sandal with a predominately textile material upper.  The upper has three wide eyelets with an elastic cord and a plastic slip-stop for tightening the upper to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The sandal also has a molded rubber/plastic bottom/outer sole.\r\r\t2. Orvis “Men’s Sandal, Brisbane” Stock #OV8041 - An open-toe, open-heel sandal with an upper consisting of two straps that cross the instep of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> plus additional straps around the ankle and behind the heel, all of which are secured and adjusted by hook-and-loop closures.   The upper has an external surface area of both leather and textile materials, with leather being the predominant external surface area upper (ESAU) material, based on our visual estimates.  The sandal also has a molded rubber/plastic bottom/outer sole.\r\r\t3. Orvis Style OR3-041, Stock names “Cambria” (men’s) and “Coronado” (women’s) - A casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> shoe with a predominately textile material upper consisting of knit textile and leather-look textile materials.

The shoe has a unit molded rubber/plastic cupsole bottom with sidewalls that overlap the upper at the sole by a variable vertical height of at least ½-inch and more, all around the shoe’s lower perimeter.  We consider this shoe to have a foxing-like band.  You state that both the women’s and the men’s versions of this shoe will be valued at over $12 per pair.  We will presume that both the men’s and women’s versions of this shoe style are of identical materials and construction, but differ only in color, sizing, or some minor design feature or ornamentation that does not effect classification.\r\r\t4. Orvis Tie Moccassin (men’s), stock name “Merritt” - A men’s casual shoe with an upper external surface area (ESAU) consisting of both mesh textile fabric and leather materials. You state and we agree, that based on visual estimates, leather is the predominant upper (ESAU) material.  The shoe also has a four-eyelet lace closure system with an elasticized cord, a textile tongue and a plastic slip-stop for tightening the shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  It also has a sewn-on rubber/plastic slip-resistant outer sole. \r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the Orvis Sandal identified as Style OR3-039, Stock names “Manatee”(men’s) and “Tula” (women’s) will be 6404.19.35, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear, in which the upper’s external surface is predominately textile materials (excluding accessories or reinforcements); in which the outer sole’s external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not “athletic footwear”; which has open toes or open heels; and which is over 10% by weight of rubber and/or plastics. The rate of duty will be 37.5% ad valorem.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the two items, identified as the Orvis “Brisbane Men’s Sandal” Stock #OV8041 and the “Orvis (men’s) Tie Mocassin,”, stock name “Merritt”, will be 6403.99.60, HTS, which provides for footwear, with uppers predominately of leather and outer soles of rubber, plastics or composition leather; which is not “sports footwear”; which does not cover the ankle; for men, youths and boys.  The rate of duty will be 8.5% ad valorem.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the item identified as the Orvis Style OR3-041, Stock names “Cambria” (men’s) and “Coronado” (women’s), will be 6404.19.90, HTS, which provides for footwear, in which the upper’s external surface is predominately textile materials; in which the outer soles external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not “athletic footwear”; which is not designed to be a protection against water, oil, or cold or inclement weather; which is not a slip-on or which has a foxing or a foxing-like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics applied at the sole and overlapping the upper; and which is valued over $12 per pair.  The rate of duty will be 9% ad valorem.\r\r\tWe are returning the samples as you requested.\r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

In a telephone conversation with this office, you also stated that it is intended for cold and/or wet weather <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  This slip-on shoe has a combination two piece upper consisting of a clog-type unit molded, rubber/plastic shell bottom <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> portion and a partially exposed, removable textile, man-made fleece lined and suede leather soled bootie insert portion. The textile bootie insert accounts for much of the shoe’s back upper external surface area, covering the wearer’s heel and the top of it is high enough to cover the wearer’s ankle. Additionally, as you point out, it also functions as the shoe’s inner sole. Based on visual measurement, we are able to determine that the external surface area of this shoe is predominately rubber and/or plastics.

All entries were\rliquidated on April 7, 1995.  A sample was provided to this\roffice for examination.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The merchandise at issue is a women's espadrille shoe,\rreferenced style name \""Mogul\"", which consists of a textile upper\rwhich features a closed toe and heel, a wedge shaped jute\rplatform midsole and a rubber outer sole.  The shoe has ten metal\reyelet holes situated near the top edges of the upper, which are\rspaced in a symmetrical pattern around the circumference of the\rtopline opening.  A 5/8 inch wide flat textile lace is laced into\rthe eyelets; after exiting the last pair of eyelets the ends are\rstill sufficiently long so that they can be wrapped and securely\rtied around the wearer's ankle.\r\r     The Protestant claims that the shoe was improperly\rclassified by Customs in subheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: other:\rvalued over $6.50 but not over $12/pair.  The Protestant argues\rthat the rubber on the outer sole merely serves as reinforcement\rand that accordingly, style Mogul should be classified in\rsubheading 6405.20.30, HTSUSA, which provides for other footwear;\rwith uppers of textile materials: with uppers of vegetable\rfibers.  In the alternative, the Protestant argues that the lace\rstrap is an ornamental feature which does not significantly hold\rthe shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer and that the shoe is held to\rthe <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by the close fitting design of the upper.  Accordingly,\rclassification is proposed in subheading 6404.19.25, HTSUSA,\rwhich provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: footwear\rwith open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that\ris held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other\rfasteners, the foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20\rand except footwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or\ralmost wholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole\rand overlapping the upper: less than 10 percent by weight of\rrubber or plastics: with uppers of vegetable fibers.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     What is the proper classification of the merchandise at\rissue?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff\rSchedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is in accordance\rwith the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 requires\rthat classification be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes.  Where goods\rcannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, the remaining\rGRI will be applied, in the order of their appearance.\r\r     Classification of goods under chapter 64, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for footwear, is determined by the materials that\rcomprise the outer soles and uppers.  Note 4(b) to that chapter\rprovides that:\r\r     The constituent material of the outer sole shall be taken to\r     be the material having the greatest surface area in contact\r     with the ground, no account being taken of accessories or\r     reinforcements such as spikes, bars, nails, protectors or\r     similar attachments.\r\r     The Protestant's first claim states that the subject shoe\rhas a jute outer sole merely reinforced with a layer of rubber;\rthe rubber serves to \""reinforce the jute outer sole primarily at\rthe toe, heel, and along its perimeter\"".  As further evidence\rthat the rubber serves merely as reinforcement, he adds that when\rthe identical merchandise is sold without the rubber\rreinforcement, exposing the jute outer sole, the subject footwear\ris considered to have outer soles of textile in accordance with\rNote 4(b).\r\r\r\r\r\r     Although Note 4(b) does provide as an exception to the outer\rsole having the greatest contact with the ground, any\r\""accessories or attachments\"", it similarly defines those terms. \rThe words \""accessories\"" and \""reinforcements\"" are followed by a\rlimited number of defining exemplars such as spikes, bars, nails,\rprotectors or similar attachments.  To conclude that by\rsimilitude an entire external surface layer of rubber soling is\rincluded within the meaning of \""similar attachments\"" is not only\runfounded but clearly contradicts the intended meaning of Note\r4(b).  The rubber soling on the subject merchandise does not\rmerely \""reinforce\"" the toe, heel and the perimeter of the shoe. \rTo the contrary, the rubber completely covers the jute bottom of\rthe shoe and acts as a rubber outer sole.  Furthermore, to add\rthat identical merchandise sold without the rubber reinforcement\ris considered to have outer soles of textile gives further\rsupport to our position that the subject merchandise has rubber\routersoles.  Merchandise is classified by Customs on a case by\rcase basis.  Shoes such as these, without rubber outer soles and\rwhich expose the existing jute midsoles would naturally be\rclassified based on the textile midsoles, which in this case\rwould serve as outer soles.  Customs has consistently classified\rthis type of espadrille shoe with a jute platform midsole and a\rheat molded-on rubber <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> surface bottom as footwear with outer\rsoles of rubber or plastics.  See e.g., HQ 953483, dated July 29,\r1993.  As such, it is our opinion that the subject merchandise\rhas an outer sole of rubber, and cannot be classified in heading\r6405, HTSUSA.\r\r     Protestant's second claim states that the textile fashion\rlace or strap merely serves as an ornamental fashion feature\rwhich does not hold the shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer.  In\rsupport of this claim reference is made to HQ 073384, dated\rDecember 22, 1983 and HQ 801649, dated November 24, 1981.  In HQ\r073384, discussing a women's imitation moccasin style casual\rshoe, Customs determined that the sample shoe was of the slip-on\rtype because:\r\r     the lace is not a functional fastener noting that it is sewn\rdown where it passes through  both the plug and the collar. \r                              Moreover, we would call this a\r                              slip-on even if the lace were not\r                              sewn down because wearers of this\r                              type of footwear normally tie the\r                              lace once to fit the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, and then\r                              slip the shoe on and off without\r                              retying the lace.\r\r     Unlike the submitted shoe, the shoe of HQ 073384 featured a\rnon-functioning lace which had been sewn down where it passes\rthrough the collar and the eyelets in the plug.  Notwithstanding,\rthe shoe in question in HQ 073384 was not like the subject\respadrille shoe which encases the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> with a soft textile upper\rbut a more rigid moccasin style shoe.  Thus, the lace strap on\rthe moccasin could easily be tied once to fit the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> allowing\rthe moccasin to be slipped on and off without further use of the\rlace strap. The same could not be said for the subject\respadrille.  The lace strap functions to conform the shoe snugly\rto the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer.  Once this is done, although it might\rbe possible to slip the shoe off, it would be more difficult to\rslip it back on without the textile upper folding into itself\rwhen the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> enters the shoe.\r\r     In HQ 801649, discussing a canvas, mock toe, rolled sole\rwoman's casual shoe, Customs determined that the sample shoe was\rof the slip-on type because:\r\r\r     The lace can be tied and untied and by pulling on the lace\r     ends through the kiltie and by tightly tying them together\r     (to keep the kiltie from returning to its usual position)\r     the shoe can be made somewhat tighter around the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>. \r     However, the effect is limited and rather awkward so we\r     believe this will rarely be done, almost certainly not each\r     time the shoe is worn.  Therefore, despite the lace, we\r     consider this a slip-on shoe.\r     \r     Although the shoe of HQ 801649 has a lace strap which allows\rthe ends to be tied together to make the shoe tighter around the\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, the ruling states that its effects are limited and awkward. \rTherefore, the presumption is that this unnecessary task will be\roften, if not always, skipped when putting on the shoe. As was\rdiscussed above, the design of the subject shoe does not\rfacilitate this option.  The subject espadrille features a lace\rstrap which is not only functional, but would render the ability\rto put on the shoe difficult without the use of the lace strap. \rThe shoe would easily collapse under the weight of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of\rthe wearer if the lace ends were not consistently readjusted\revery time the shoe was worn, regardless of their length.  Thus,\ralthough the long lace may have been designed to be wrapped\raround the ankle merely for its ornamental appeal, the design of\rthe shoe requires that the lace be passed around the wearer's\rankle and tied to hold the shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Additionally, it\rshould be noted that contrary to the Protestant's assertion that\rthe shoe stays securely on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> even without the use of the\rlace strap, when the submitted shoe was worn without the use of\rthe lace strap, the shoe slipped off the wearer's <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>. \rAccordingly, it is our position that the submitted sample is not\rof the slip-on type and that it has a rubber/plastic outer sole.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The subject espadrille shoe, referenced style name \""Mogul\"",\rwas correctly classified in subheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: other:\rvalued over $6.50 but not over $12/pair.  The applicable rate of\rduty is 90 cents/pr plus 20 perecent ad valorem.\r\r     The protest should be denied in full and a copy of this\rruling should be appended to the CF 19 Notice of Action to\rsatisfy the notice requirement of section 174.30(a) Customs\rRegulations.\r\r     In accordance with Section 3(A)(11)(b) of Customs Directive\r099 3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject: Revised Protest\rDirective, this decision should be mailed by your office to the\rProtestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter. \rAny reliquidation of the entry in accordance with the decision\rmust be accomplished prior to mailing of the decision.

Box 68\rFairhaven, MA   02719\r\rRE: Tariff Classification of “Chafer Gear”\r\rDear Mr. Browne:\r\rThis letter concerns your request for a ruling involving the tariff classification of  “Chafer Gear”under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA).\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe product is an eight-<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> long, loosely-twisted group of polyethylene or polypropylene monofilaments with an estimated twist of approximately 3 to 4 turns per meter.  The product has a loose, rope-like appearance and is approximately 1 ½ inches in diameter.  The filaments are crudely secured at the center of the group with a piece of black plastic tape. \t\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper tariff classification of the product, identified as “chafer gear,” under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\fClassification of merchandise under the HTSUSA, is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI’s) and in accordance with the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI’s may then be applied.  The Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (EN’s), which represent the official interpretation of the tariff at the international level, facilitate classification under the HTSUSA by offering guidance in understanding the scope of the headings and GRI’s.\r\rAccording to your description, the product, is used to attach to fishing nets to reduce the abrasion when the net is being used. The federal regulations that govern ground fish trawl under the Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 50 CFR Part 663.2(c), \""chafing gear\"" is defined as \""webbing or other material attached to the bottom (underside) or around the codend of a trawl net to protect the codend from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.\""\r\r  Clearly, this product has been designed to provide protection to the net and is used in the fishing industry  for that purpose.

All of the items are designed to be worn for the claimed benefits of compression to the joints, stabilization, and relief from pain and swelling. Each of these compression items is composed of 80% polyamide, 14% elastane and 6% polyester knit fabric.  Each item is unisex and will be available in various sizes. \r\rThe first three samples cover the upper ankle area to just below the arch area.  The toes are completely open.  \r\rStyle #K602834000 protect.Leva strap, supports joint function with an adjustable strap that crisscrosses over the top of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The strap is held in place using a hook-and-loop strip along the length of the strap.  The strap allows the wearer to tighten the fit over the top of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> to accommodate swelling in the upper area of the ankle and heel. \r\rStyle #K610804000 protect.Achi, supports the ankle and features padding on both sides of the ankle area to support the Achilles tendon.

The sleeve-type elbow support features padding on the outer and inner sides.  You state the padding will massage and reduce swelling of the elbow and thereby provide increased mobility.\r\rStyle #K640832000 protect.Manu active, supports the wrist and palm area.  The item includes a rod, which has been knitted into the palm-side.  The adjustable strap is made up with a hook-and-loop strip which you state helps to alleviate pain in the wrist.  The stiff rod is meant to prevent strain by limiting movement of the palm.\r\rStyle #K620804000 protect.Genu, provides support of the knee.  The sleeve-type knee support pulls on over the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  It is designed to fit over the top of the calf to the lower thigh.  To alleviate strain, two rods have been knitted into the left and right sides of the sleeve to provide stability.  In the knee area, an oval-shaped foam ring is inserted to provide extra protection for the knee and aid in reducing swelling and irritation.\r\rThe applicable subheading for the six compression articles Styles #K602834000, #K610804000, #K600804000, #K630804000, #K640832000 and #K620804000, will be 6307.90.9889, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for other made up textile articles, other.

We received two samples from you.\r\u000BFACTS:  \r\rYou describe the subject merchandise, item 08498, the Piggie Play <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Rattle, as tiny rattle/squeaker socks for infants ages birth and up. The merchandise is made of polyester pique knit fabric.  You state the merchandise is designed for infants to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> on their feet in a “playing environment”.  Each sock has piggy heads with a rattle and squeaker inside of each piggy head.  You state the squeaker and rattle helps the infant discover the wonders of playing with his/her tiny toes and listening to the sounds of the rattle and squeaker as the infant moves and kicks his/her feet.  You also state the merchandise has a play feature within as the socks are designed to have little piggy heads and numbers so the parent can play “This little piggy” and count the infant’s toes as they play along.\r\rISSUE:\t\r\r\tWhat is the classification of the subject merchandise?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tMerchandise is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  When goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1 and if the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes do not require otherwise, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 may be applied. \r\r\tAdditionally, the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) are the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS.  See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed.

Accordingly, we incorporate the LAW AND ANALYSIS section of these rulings in this decision.  Please find enclosed a copy of the final Notice of Modification, dated January 4, 2006, which contains the two referenced rulings.  \r\r\tTherefore, the merchandise at issue is classified within subheading 6111.30.5050, HTSUSA, which provides for “Babies’ garments and clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted:  Of synthetic fibers:  Other…Other:  Babies’ socks and booties.” \r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tThe Piggie Play <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Rattle, item 08498, is classifiable in subheading 6111.30.5050, HTSUSA, which provides for “Babies’ garments and clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted:  Of synthetic fibers:  Other…Other:  Babies’ socks and booties.”  The general column one duty rate is 16 percent.

Farrow, Ltd.\r475A Admiral Blvd.\rMississauga, L5T 2N1\rCanada\r\r\rRE:\tThe tariff classification of footwear insoles from Canada\r\u000BDear Ms. Long:\r\rIn your letters dated April 11, 2022, and June 1, 2022,  you requested a tariff classification ruling on behalf of your client, Orpyx Medical Technologies, Inc. You have submitted descriptive literature, diagrams, photographs, and marketing materials for two styles of footwear insoles.  No samples were submitted with your request. \r\rThe Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles and Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles are removable footwear insoles available to men and women in a full complement of shoe sizes. In your correspondence, you state the insoles are not available in retail establishments and are targeted to patients of podiatrists.  The Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles are constructed in three layers and the Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles, which might be prescribed for those needing additional <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> support, are constructed with an additional foam layer that can be molded.  The base layer of both versions is composed of Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) to provide durability.  The next layer incorporates the OSI Sensory System consisting of multiple pressure and temperature sensors (27-37 sensors depending upon insole size), 6-axis IMUs that utilize accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc., and Cellular and Bluetooth transmitters.  The top foam layers consist of rubber/plastics such as EVA and polyurethane covered with a microfiber lining.  The insoles are packed with charging wires, enabling a weekly or biweekly charge.\r\rWhen the insoles are worn, both versions collect physiologic data such as <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>-time, pressure, step count, orientation, and temperature while the user performs their daily activities.  The data analytics gathered is transmitted via cellular and Bluetooth™ technology to the internet.  Data patterns can be accessed and monitored by phone, tablet, computer, etc., by the wearer and medical professionals with the goal of effective decision-making regarding designing care plans to manage, and to possibly prevent, diabetic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> ulcers and other <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> problems.\r\rIn your letter, you suggest that the Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles and Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles are classified under subheading 9021.10.0090, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), as orthopedic appliances.  We disagree.  Note (6) to Chapter 90 states “[f]or the purposes of heading 9021 … [o]rthopedic appliances include footwear and special insoles designed to correct orthopedic conditions, provided that they are either (1) made to measure or (2) mass-produced, entered singly and not in pairs and designed to fit either <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> equally.”  In this case, both types of insoles help individuals, who may or may not have a pre-existing diabetic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> ulcer, to manage and prevent diabetic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> ulcers.  They are not designed to correct orthopedic conditions.  In addition, the Flex Sensory Insoles are mass produced, presented in pairs, and made in left and right configurations that are not designed to fit either <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> equally.  Although one of the foam layers of the Custom Sensory Insoles can be modified to accommodate various special requirements such as depressions for offloading and may be considered made to measure, they do not correct orthopedic conditions.  As such, they will not be classified in heading 9021, HTSUS.\r\rThe applicable subheading for the Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles and Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles will be 6406.90.3060, HTSUS, which provides for parts of footwear; other: removable insoles, heel cushions and similar articles; of rubber or plastics; other.

Hjelm\rAkin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP\r1333 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W.\rWashington, DC 20036-1564\r\rRE:\tRevocation of New York Ruling Letter N239002, dated March 29, 2013; tariff classification of the Nike Studio Wrap Pack\r\rDear Mr. Hjelm:\r\r\tThis letter is to inform you that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has reconsidered New York Ruling Letter (NY) N239002, issued to your client, Nike USA, Inc. (“Nike”) on March 29, 2013, concerning the tariff classification of a collection of footwear articles contained in Nike’s “Studio Wrap Pack” (Item #324734). In ruling letter NY N239002, CBP determined that the Studio Wrap Pack was not classifiable as “goods put up in sets for retail sale,” pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 3(b), and concluded that the component articles of the Studio Wrap Pack should be separately classified, pursuant to GRI 1, in their respective headings.  Upon your request, dated April 30, 2013, CBP has reviewed NY N239002 and finds the ruling to be in error.  Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below, CBP is revoking ruling letter NY N239002.\r\rPursuant to section 625(c)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. §1625(c)(1)), as amended by section 623 of Title VI, notice of the proposed action was published in the Customs Bulletin, Vol. 50, No. 10, on March 9, 2016. No comments were received in response to the notice.\r\rFACTS:\r\r\tIn ruling letter NY N239002, CBP described the Nike Studio Wrap Pack, Model No. 324734, as a collection of articles put up for sale together to provide a consumer with <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction during exercise activities.  The Studio Wrap Pack is imported in a condition suitable for sale directly to users without repacking, and each Studio Wrap Pack consists of the following individual articles:\r\r1 Pair of <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps: Each <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap is constructed of strips of knit textile that has been laminated with polyurethane cellular rubber.  The strips are sewn together in a shape that wraps around the heel, lower ankle, and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, while leaving the toes exposed.  Synthetic traction dots are attached to the bottom of <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap, along slip soles that cover the heel and midfoot areas of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps account for 43.4% of the Studio Wrap Pack total cost.\r\r\u0001\rNike Studio Wrap Pack, the “<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap,” \r\rThe <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps are designed to provide a near-barefoot experience during exercise activities such as yoga, pilates, and barre, while also delivering <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction on studio and gym floor surfaces.  The <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap is also intended to be worn in combination with the Strap and is designed to fit inside the slip-on Flats, allowing a user to travel to and from the studio or gym while wearing the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap.  However, as the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap does not possess an outer sole or toe coverings, it would be impractical to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap outside, without the combined use of the Flats.\r\rNike states in its February 25, 2013 tariff classification ruling request that it intends to sell the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap as part of the Studio Wrap Pack, and in the future, separately with the Straps.\r\r2 Straps: Each Strap consists of a cellular rubber ribbon that is designed to be wrapped over the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap and around the ankle.  The Strap provides additional support to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and ankle and accessorizes the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap’s fashion appearance.  Use of the Straps with the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps is optional.\r\r\u0001\rNike Studio Wrap Pack, the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap with a tied “Strap” around the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and ankle\r\r1 Pair of slip-on Flats: The slip-on Flats consist of a textile-majority upper with a rubber/plastic outer sole.  The Flats have no closure devices and are designed to be worn over the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps or separately, without the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps, in combination with the removable Insoles.  Nike states that the Flats account for 32% of the Studio Wrap pack’s total cost.\r\r\u0001\rNike Studio Wrap Pack, the “Flat,” worn over a <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap with tied Strap\r\r2 Insoles: The removable Insoles are designed to be optionally inserted into the Flats and are constructed of textile-covered foam.  A consumer, when not wearing the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps, can insert the Insoles into the Flats for additional cushioning while walking.\r\r1 Mesh Bag: The Mesh Bag is constructed of synthetic fibers and is large enough to hold the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Straps.  It is designed to provide the consumer with a protective bag in which to launder the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Straps.  The design of the Mesh Bag allows water and detergent to rinse and clean the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Straps, while simultaneously protecting the items from damage during the washing cycle.\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhether the Nike Studio Wrap Pack is properly classified, pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 3(b), as goods put up in sets for retail sale, or whether the individual components of the Studio Wrap Pack should be separately classified, by application of GRI 1, in their respective headings.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tMerchandise imported into the United States is classified under the HTSUS.  Tariff classification is governed by the principals set forth in the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs) and, in the absence of special language or context with requires otherwise, by the Additional U.S. Rules of Interpretation.  The GRIs and the Additional U.S. Rules of Interpretation are part of the HTSUS and are to be considered statutory provisions of law for all purposes.\r\r\tGRI 1 requires that classification be determine first according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes and, unless otherwise required, according to the remaining GRIs taken in their appropriate order.\r\r\tThe HTSUS provisions under consideration in this case are as follows:\r\r6402\tOther footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics\r\r6404\tFootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While not legally binding, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HS and are thus useful in ascertaining the proper classification of merchandise.  It is CBP’s practice to follow, whenever possible, the terms of the ENs when interpreting the HTSUS.  See T.D. 89-90, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rAs an initial matter, CBP observes that the Nike Studio Wrap Pack consists of a variety of individual articles (the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps, Flats, Straps, Insoles, and Mesh Bag), packaged together for retail sale, that are, prima facie, classifiable in two or more headings.  Specifically, there is no dispute that the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps are described by heading 6402, HTSUS; the Flats are described by heading 6404, HTSUS; the Straps are described by heading 6307, HTSUS; the Insoles are described by heading 6406, HTSUS; and that the Mesh Bag is described by heading 6307, HTSUS.  \r\rConsequently, because the Nike Studio Wrap Pack is, prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected by application of GRI 3—specifically GRI 3(b), which directs that “[g]oods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character.” \u0002  \r\rFor purposes of tariff classification under GRI 3(b), the term “sets for retail sale” carries a specific meaning that is defined in detail by EN (X) to GRI 3(b).  Specifically, EN (X) to GRI 3(b) states: \r\r(X)\tFor the purpose of this Rule, the term 'goods put up in sets for retail sale' shall be taken to mean goods which:\r\r(a)\tconsist of at least two different articles which are, prima facie, classifiable in  different headings . . . ;\r\r(b)\tconsist of products or articles put up together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity; and\r \r(c)\tare put up in a manner suitable for sale directly to users without repacking (e.g., in boxes or cases or on boards).\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\rUpon consideration of whether the component articles of the Nike Studio Wrap Pack are properly classifiable as a “set” under GRI 3, there is no dispute that the merchandise is described by criteria (a) and (c), as set forth in EN (X) to GRI 3(b).  Consistent with EN (X)(a) and (c) to GRI 3(b), the individual component articles of the Studio Wrap Pack are, prima facie, classifiable in different headings; likewise, the articles are packaged together in a retail box that is suitable for sale directly to users without repacking.  Consequently, because the Nike Studio Wrap Pack satisfies criterion (a) and (c) of the EN (X) to GRI 3(b), the determination as to whether the Studio Wrap Pack is classifiable as “goods put up in sets for retail sale” turns on whether the merchandise is also described by EN(X)(b), which states that “sets” must consist of products or articles put up “to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity.”\r\rThe courts have provided guidance on the meaning of “products or articles put up together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity” for purposes of classification pursuant to GRI 3(b). See Estee Lauder, Inc. v. United States, 815 F. Supp. 2d 1287, 1294 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2012).  In Estee Lauder, the Court of International Trade (CIT) considered the classification of several cosmetic items put up together for retail sale, and concluded that because each item was specifically related to makeup and possessed an identifiable, individual function that was intended for use together or in conjunction with one another for the single activity of putting on makeup, the cosmetic items met the particular need of makeup application and were therefore, properly classified pursuant to GRI 3(b). Id. at 1295-96.  Noting that each of the exemplars provided in the ENs consist of individual components that are used together or in conjunction with another for a single purpose or activity, the CIT agreed that “for goods put up together to meet the ‘particular need’ or ‘specific activity’ requirement and thereby be deemed a set, they must be so related as to be clearly intended for use together or in conjunction with one another for a single purpose or activity.” Id. (citing with approval CBP’s Informed Compliance Publication, “Classification of Sets”, 12 (2004)).\u0002\r\rConsistent with the courts’ interpretation of the terms “particular need” and “specific activity” in EN (X)(b) to  GRI 3(b), CBP finds that the individual component articles of the Nike Studio Wrap Pack are put up together for use in a single purpose or activity.  Specifically, they are designed for use in conjunction with one another to provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and floor traction during yoga, pilates, and barre exercise activities.  \r\rMoreover, CBP notes that the complementary design of the individual component articles makes it such that a consumer would not purchase the Studio Wrap Pack to use the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps or Flats without the other.  That the Flats may be used as conventional footwear, independent of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps, does not negate the fact that the Flats are put up with the other component articles for the particular activity of exercising.  Consequently, upon consideration of the character and use of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps, Straps, Flats, Insoles, and Mesh Bag with one another, CBP concludes that the Studio Wrap Pack is fully described by EN(X)(b) to GRI 3, because the merchandise is put up together to provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and floor traction during yoga, pilates, and barre exercise activities.\r\rWith respect to the Mesh Bag included with the Studio Wrap Pack to transport, store, and wash the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Straps, CBP notes that in Estee Lauder, the CIT repeatedly referred to cases and containers, suitable for general use and classifiable elsewhere in the Nomenclature, as non-functional set components contemplated under GRI 3(b). Estee Lauder, 815 F. Supp. 2d at 1299-1300 (citing EN (X) to GRI3(b)).  In each example, the inclusion of a case or container with a set, although suitable for general use, did not negate the set’s qualification under GRI 3(b). Id. \r\rUsed in conjunction with the Studio Wrap Pack, the Mesh Bag facilitates the transport, storage, and care of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Straps which enable the Studio Wrap Pack to fulfill the specific activity that makes it a set.  The fact that the Mesh Bag is suitable for other general uses or is designed for the ancillary care and transport of only some of the set components does not negate a finding that the Mesh Bag, when considered together with the functional articles of the Studio Wrap Pack, forms part of a set that is put up together to provide a person with <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction during exercise activities.     \r\rPursuant to the text of GRI 3(b), goods put up in sets for retail sale must be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which “gives them their essential character.”\u0002  The phrase “essential character” carries specific meaning in the context of tariff classification, and the courts have defined “essential character” as, “that which is indispensable to the structure, core or condition of the article, i.e., what it is.” Structural Industries v. United States, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1330, 1336 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2005).  \r\rEN VIII to GRI 3(b) explains that “[t]he factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods,” and may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of the constituent material in relation to the use of the goods. See EN VIII to GRI 3(b).  However, among those factors identified in EN VIII to GRI 3(b), recent court decisions concerning “essential character” analysis under GRI 3(b) have primarily focused on the role of the constituent material in relation to the use of the goods. See Estee Lauder, 815 F. Supp. 2d at 1296; see also Structural Industries, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1330; Conair Corp. v. United States, 29 C.I.T. 888 (2005); Home Depot USA, Inc. v. United States, 427 F. Supp. 2d 1278 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2006), aff’d 491 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \r\rConsistent with the guidance provided by the courts and the ENs to GRI 3, CBP evaluates the functional components of a set when determining what article or component imparts a set with its essential character.  Relevant to the classification of the instant merchandise, CBP has previously found that the essential character of sets consisting of footwear sold in combination with a bag or pouch is often imparted by the functional article of footwear. See Headquarters ruling letter (“HQ”) H008845, October 3, 2008 (finding that a pair of bowling shoes imparted the essential character of a set consisting of bowling shoes, a plastic slip-on shoe cover for one of the shoes, a fabric shoe bag, and a smaller \""sole and heel\"" bag containing four interchangeable soles and four interchangeable heels ); NY N239273, dated April 2, 2013 (finding that the articles of footwear imparted the essential character of a set consisting of a pair of slip-on dance shoes and a polyester carrying pouch).\r\rHere, the essential character of the Nike Studio Wrap Pack is imparted by the functional items used to provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction for exercise activities, namely the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats.  CBP finds that the Insoles, Straps, and Mesh Bag serve supporting roles in providing <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction for purchasers.  The role of the Insoles is to provide additional cushioning for the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> when used in the Flats and is not essential to the use of the Studio Wrap Pack.  Similarly, the relative low bulk and value of the Straps and Mesh Bag, combined with the fact that the components do not provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection or traction when used independently of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats, are evidence of the components’ supportive role in facilitating the use and care of the items that enable the Studio Wrap Pack to fulfill the specific activity that makes it a set.  Accordingly, CBP finds that the Insoles, Straps, and Mesh Bag do not impart the Studio Wrap Pack with its essential character. \r\rBy contrast, it is apparent upon first impression that the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats are functional items of the Studio Wrap Pack.  The <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction and are necessary for the particular activity of the set.  Without either component, a purchaser could not protect his or her feet or gain additional traction as compared to barefoot exercise.\r\rIn determining whether the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps or Flats impart the Studio Wrap Pack with its essential character, CBP observes that the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats are designed to be used, separately or in combination with one another, to provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction for exercise activities.  Accordingly, CBP finds that the articles share equal importance in fulfilling the particular need or specific activity associated with the Studio Wrap Pack. See EN(X), GRI 3(b). Similarly, the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats share similar individual unit production costs; the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats account for 43.4% and 32%, respectively, of the total production cost of the Studio Wrap Pack.  Consequently, because the specific role, function, and unit production cost of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats do not distinguish either article as uniquely indispensable to the “structure, core, or condition” of the Studio Wrap Pack, CBP cannot determine whether the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps or Flats impart the merchandise with its essential character. See Structural Industries v. United States, 360 F. Supp. 2d at 1336.\r\rWhen goods cannot be classified by reference to GRI 3(a) or 3(b), GRI (c) instructs that they shall be classified “under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.”  Here, CBP has determined that the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats are equally important to the essential character of the Studio Wrap Pack.  The <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps are classifiable in heading 6402, HTSUS; and the Flats are classifiable in heading 6404, HTSUS.  Accordingly, by application of GRI 3(c), CBP finds that the Nike Studio Wrap Pack is classifiable in heading 6404, HTSUS, which provides for, “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials.”\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tBy application of GRI 3(c), the Nike Studio Wrap Pack is classified in heading 6404, HTSUS, specifically subheading 6404.19.39, HTSUS, which provides for “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: Other: Footwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except footwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper: Other: Other.”  The column one, general rate of duty under this provision is 37.5%, ad valorem.\r\rDuty rates are provided for convenience only and are subject to change.

The upper is fabric and covers the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> from just forward of the instep to the back of the heel, but not any of the toes.  The two sides of the upper open wide to allow the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> to be set down on the insole without bending.  The sides of the upper are secured by two fabric straps.  The straps have hook and loop closures.  The sample is symmetrical down its long axis, i.e., it is neither a “left” nor a “right”, and its insole is unusually wide, about 4 inches across the base of the wearer’s toes, compared to its length, 10 inches.  It is not labeled with a shoe size, but “S”, which we take to be Small.

Davies\rTower Group International, Inc.\rP.O. Box 19169\rCharlotte, North Carolina  28217-9169\r\rRE: Tariff Classification of “Chafing Yarn”\r\rDear Mr. Davies:\r\rThis letter concerns your request for a ruling involving the tariff classification of  “Chafing Yarn”under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA).\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe subject article is described as “chafing yarn” for use as chafing gear on trawl nets.  \rThe “yarn” is composed of approximately thirty polyethylene monofilaments, which are twisted together to form a twisted cord which is approximately 3 millimeters in diameter.  Approximately sixty of these cords are then twisted together to form the “chafing yarn” in its imported condition.  Its overall appearance is a long, loosely twisted rope made of individual cords, the overall diameter of the rope being approximately 1 inch.  The overall decitex of each of the sixty strands would be about 29,328.   The material is imported in 600-foot lengths.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper tariff classification of the product, identified as “chafing yarn,” under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\fClassification of merchandise under the HTSUSA, is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI’s) and in accordance with the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI’s may then be applied.  The Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (EN’s), which represent the official interpretation of the tariff at the international level, facilitate classification under the HTSUSA by offering guidance in understanding the scope of the headings and GRI’s.\r\rIt is our understanding that this product is imported in 600 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths.  The 1-inch diameter rope is cut into nine to ten <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths so that it may be tied onto the end of fishing nets.\rWith regard to its technical use, the federal regulations that govern ground fish trawl under the Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 50 CFR Part 663.2(c), \""chafing gear\"" is defined as \""webbing or other material attached to the bottom (underside) or around the codend of a trawl net to protect the codend from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.\""\r\r  Clearly, this product has been designed to provide protection to the net and is used in the fishing industry  for that purpose.  The word “chafer” is defined in Webster’s 3rd New International Dictionary as \""a strip of fabric covering the head of a tire as a protection from chafing against the rim.\""  In the subject case, once the loosely twisted  rope has unraveled, it forms a fabric-like covering comprised of textile filament strands which protect the codend of the net from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> or \""chafing.\""\r\rAlthough heading 5608 of the HTSUSA, covers \""Knotted netting of twine, cordage or rope; made up fishing nets and other made up nets, of textile materials,\"" there is no break-out provision for \""parts of nets\"" under this heading.  Even if there were such a provision, the product is imported in 600 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths and must be cut into nine to ten <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths in order to be attached as \""parts of nets.\""  We must classify this product pursuant to the condition in which it is imported, i.e., 600 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths.  Thus, it is our determination that the subject \""chafing yarn\"" is classifiable pursuant to GRI 1 because it is most specifically described  under subheading 5607.49.2500, HTSUSA, as \""Twine, cordage, ropes and cables, whether or not plaited or braided and whether or not impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber or plastics.\"" \r\rThis product is described as being made of “ high density polyethylene monofialment- twisted together to form a single strand, neither braided nor plated.”  As we have already noted, 5607, HTSUSA, clearly indicates that the heading includes ropes even if they have not been plaited or braided.  The fact that this heading is intended to cover this type of loosely twisted rope is further reinforced by  the EN’s for heading 5607 which specifically states that ropes which have been produced by twisting are covered under this heading.  Specifically, the EN states that heading 5607 \""covers twine, cordage, ropes and cables, produced by twisting or by plaiting or braiding (emphasis supplied).\""\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\fThe product identified as \""chafing yarn\"" is classifiable under subheading 5607.49.2500, HTSUSA, as \""Twine, cordage, ropes and cables, whether or not plaited or braided and whether or not impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber or plastics: Of polyethylene or polypropylene:  Other: Other, not braided or plaited: Other.\""   This provision is dutiable at the general column one rate of 24 cents/kilogram plus 14.2 percent ad valorem.  The textile restraint category is 201.\r\rThe designated textile and apparel category may  be subdivided into parts.  If so, visa and quota requirements applicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since part categories are the result of international bilateral agreements which are subject to frequent negotiations and changes, to obtain the most current information available, we suggest that you check, close to the time of shipment, the Status Report On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an issuance of the U.S. Customs Service, which is updated weekly and is available at your local Customs office.\r\rDue to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation (the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the restraint (quota/visa) categories, you should contact your local Customs office prior to importing the merchandise to determine the current status of any import restraints or requirements.\r\rSincerely,\r\rJohn Durant, Director\rTariff Classification Appeals Division\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1996/959802.doc"",""id"":13861,""rulingNumber"":""959802"",""subject"":""Tariff Classification of “Chafing Yarn”"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1996-12-24T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""5607.49.2500""]}"

You continue, “The upper is man made fiber and covers the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> from just forward of the instep to the heel. The two sides of the upper open wide to allow the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> to be set down on the shoe without bending.  The sides of the upper are secured by man made fiber straps threaded through plastic D-rings.  The straps have hook and loop closures.  The merchandise is imported in single units, not pairs”.\r\r\tFrom our examination, we note that the sample is symmetrical down its long axis, i.e., it is neither a “left” nor a “right”.  Also, it is not labeled with a shoe size, but “WM”, which we take to be Women’s Medium.  Both of these facts support your claims\rthat they will be imported in single units and that they will be worn only following <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> injury or surgery, routinely via a physician’s prescription.   \r\r\tAs you have noted, the Notice published in the Customs Bulletin of March 18, 1998, proposing, in essence, to change the classification of similar items from HTS 9021 to HTS 6404 after a Change of Practice Notice in the Federal Register, has not led to any such Change of Practice.  Therefore, the previous rulings you cite do presently remain in effect.  Although the .7 inch thick outer sole in your sample is somewhat more flexible than the one in the ruling you cite because of significant thinning in the mid-<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> along both sides, we agree it is still unusually rigid enough to ensure that it would be almost impossible to walk in a pair of them.  The upper is almost identical. \r\r\tWe also note that the reason given in the CB Notice of January 7, 1998 for the underlying classification change was a classification decision made in March of 1996 by the Harmonized System Committee of the World Customs Organization.  That decision was contrary to the previous rulings by U.S. Customs on similar items and the recommendation by NIS J. Sheridan, then assigned footwear in this Division, concerning the sample before them.  We note that, in the interim, the HSC-WCO has apparently had second thoughts in this area.  Per HSC-WCO document NG0017B1, a new chapter note is scheduled to be inserted in the Harmonized System as of January 1, 2002, which will state, “Orthopaedic appliances include footwear...mass-produced, presented singly and not in pairs and designed to fit either <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> equally”.  Of course, the United States will be obliged then to incorporate that Note into the HTS, assuming it goes into effect as planned. This would, of course, make moot the change of classification under the current HTS of future importations of items, like yours, which meet the new language.    \r\r\tThe applicable subheading for this footwear will be 9021.19.85.00, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for “other” orthopedic or fracture appliances.  The duty rate will be free.\r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Section 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of this ruling letter or the control number indicated above should be attached to the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

As requested, your samples are being returned.\r\rThe first garment, Style CL1315, which you identify as a bicycle shirt, is a men’s pullover garment constructed from 60 percent polyester, 40 percent polyamide, dropped stitch, mesh knit fabric that measures 35 stitches per 2 centimeters counted in the horizontal direction.  Style CL1315 has a self-fabric mock turtleneck; a partial front opening with a zipper closure; short, hemmed sleeves; a rear pouch pocket that extends across the lower back and is divided into three separate compartments; and a tunnel elastic bottom with a curved tail.   \r\r\tThe second garment, Style CL1305, which you identify as a bicycle bib short, is a pair of men’s padded bib shorts that will be constructed of finely knit fabric in either 60 percent polyester, 40 percent polyamide, or 75 percent polyamide, 25 percent elastane.  The one piece pull-on garment has shoulder straps that measure two and one half inches in width; oversized armholes; deeply cut front and rear panels that provide partial covering of the front and back above the waist; and gripper strips at the leg openings.  The garment has a multi-layered thickly padded insert in the crotch and seat area that consists of an outer layer of synthetic chamois with inner layers of foam.  The insert prevents abrasion and chafing and absorbs sweat while biking.  The padded insert is cumbersome, making the garment too restrictive for everyday <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>. \r\rThe third item, no style number stated, is identified as a pair of leg warmers that will be constructed of finely knit fabric in either 60 percent polyester, 40 percent polyamide or 80 percent polyamide, 20 percent elastane.  The leg warmers extend from the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> to above the knee and have self-fabric <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> straps that extend under the instep and gripper strips at the top. \r\rThe fourth and fifth items, Style CL1368, identified as arm warmers, and Style CL1584, identified as knee warmers, cannot be classified without a sample of each item.\r\rThe applicable subheading for Style CL1315 will be 6110.30.3050, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, (HTS), which provides for: sweaters, pullovers, sweatshirts, waistcoats (vests) and similar articles, knitted or crocheted: of man-made fibers: other: other: other: men’s or boys’.  The rate of duty is 32.4 per cent ad valorem.\r\rThe applicable subheading for Style CL1305 will be 6114.30.3060, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, (HTS), which provides for: other garments, knitted or crocheted: of man-made fibers: other: other: men’s or boys’.  The rate of duty is 15.1 per cent ad valorem.\r\rThe applicable subheading for the leg warmers will be 6406.99.1510, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, (HTS), which provides for: gaiters, leggings and similar articles, and parts thereof: other: of other materials: of textile materials: of man-made fibers: leg warmers: other.  The rate of duty is 15.3 per cent ad valorem.\r\rStyle CL1315 falls within textile category designation 638. Style CL1305 and the leg warmers fall within textile category designation 659.  Based upon international textile trade agreements, products of Italy are not subject to visa requirements or quota restraints.\r\rThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\t\r\rA copy of this ruling letter or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

Photographs were submitted for our examination.  The\rValue and Marking Branch of our office will respond separately to\ryou regarding the marking issue.\r\rFACTS:\r\r    The artificial trees, wreaths, and garlands are made of\rpolyvinyl chloride evergreen and pine needle leaves and branches.\rThey will be imported into the U.S. decorated with various hanging\rornaments, ribbons, artificial foliage, and lights.  The\rmerchandise, which will be displayed in the J.C. Penney stores\rsolely for decorative and marketing purposes, includes the\rfollowing:\r\r    1) 7 and 5 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> Christmas trees (Lot #7448 and #7449)   \rincluding ribbons, plastic balls, plastic pine cones, metal      \rSanta ornaments, red foil balls, plastic drum ornaments,    and\rholly berries with leaves;\r\r    2) 40 and 30 inch wreaths (Lot #7452 and #7453) including\r    ribbons, plastic berries, and plastic pine cones;\r\r    3) 10 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> garlands (Lot #7450) including ribbons and plastic\r    berries;\r\r    4) 10 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> garlands (Lot #7451) including plastic berries,\r    ribbons, plastic pine cones, and a rod iron stand;\r\r\r                               -2-\r\r    5) wreaths (Lot #7454) including ribbons, berries with  leaves,\r    pine cones, and a rod iron stand;\r\r    6) 7 and 5 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> Christmas trees (Lot #7461 and #7462)        \r    including plastic ball ornaments, ribbons, bows, styrofoam\r    ornaments, and icicle spiral ornaments;\r\r    7) 10 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> garlands (Lot #7463) including plastic ball\r    ornaments, ribbons, bows, and icicle ornaments;\r\r    8) 7 and 5 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> Christmas trees (Lot #7455 and #7496)   \r    including ribbons, berries, and styrofoam ball ornaments;\r\r    9) 30 inch wreaths and 10 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> garlands (Lot #7459 and #7456)\r    including berries, ribbons, and styrofoam ball ornaments;\r\r    10) garlands (Lot #7457) including ribbons, ball ornaments,\r    and a rod iron stand;\r\r    11) wreaths (Lot #7460) including ribbons, berries, and a rod\r    iron stand; and\r\r    12) wreaths (Lot #7464) including berries, lights, and a     \r    deer head centerpiece.\r\rISSUE:\r\r    Whether the articles are classified, in their entirety, in\rsubheading 9505.10.40, HTSUSA, as festive articles, articles for\rChristmas festivities, other, of plastics or are classified in\rseparate HTSUSA headings providing for their individual components.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r    The General Rules of Interpretation (GRI's) taken in their\rappropriate order provide a framework for classification of\rmerchandise under the HTSUSA.  Most imported goods are classified\rby application of GRI 1, that is, according to the terms of the\rheadings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter\rnotes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on\rthe basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not\rotherwise require, the remaining GRI's may then be applied.  The\rExplanatory Notes (EN's) to the Harmonized Commodity Description\rand Coding System, which represent the official interpretation of\rthe tariff at the international level, facilitate classification\runder the HTSUSA by offering guidance in understanding the scope\rof the headings and GRI's.\r    \r    Heading 9505 provides for, inter alia, festive, carnival and\rother entertainment articles.  The EN's to 9505 indicate that the\rheading covers:\r\r\r                               -3-\r\r          (A) Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles,\r          which in view of their intended use are generally \r          made of non-durable material.  They include:\r\r               (1) Decorations such as festoons, garlands,       \r               Chinese lanterns, etc., as well as various        \r               decorative articles made of paper, metal foil,    \r               glass fibre, etc., for Christmas trees (e.g.,     \r               tinsel, stars, icicles), artificial snow, coloured\r               balls, bells, lanterns, etc.  Cake and other      \r               decorations (e.g., animals, flags) which          \r               are traditionally associated with a particular    \r               festival are also classified here.\r\r               (2) Articles traditionally used at Christmas\r               festivities, e.g., artificial Christmas trees     \r               (these are sometimes of the folding type),        \r               nativity scenes, Christmas crackers, Christmas    \r               stockings, imitation yule logs....\r\r                             *  *  *\r\r     In general, merchandise is classifiable in heading 9505,\rHTSUSA, as a festive article when the article, as a whole:\r\r     1.   is of non-durable material or, generally, is not\r          purchased because of its extreme worth, or intrinsic   \r          value (e.g., paper, cardboard, metal foil, glass fiber,\r          plastic, wood);\r\r     2.   functions primarily as a decoration (e.g., its primary\r          function is not utilitarian); and\r\r     3.   is traditionally associated or used with a particular\r          festival (e.g., stockings and tree ornaments for       \r          Christmas, decorative eggs for Easter).\r\r     An article's satisfaction of these three criteria is\rindicative of classification as a festive article.  The motif of\ran article is not dispositive of its classification and,\rconsequently, does not transform an item into a festive article.\r     \r     First, the articles are made of non-durable material.  Customs\rwill consider these articles, of artificial foliage, to be made of\rnon-durable material since they are not designed for sustained <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>\rand tear, nor are purchased because of their extreme worth or value\r(as would be the case with a decorative, yet costly, piece of art\ror crystal).\r\r\r\r                               -4-\r\r     Next, the articles' primary function is decorative, as opposed\rto, utilitarian.  It is apparent, they serve no useful function\rbesides their role as decoration.\r\r     Finally, when examining the trees, wreaths, and garlands, as\ra whole, it is evident that the articles are traditionally\rassociated or used with the particular festival of Christmas. \rArtificial Christmas trees are cited in the EN's to 9505, as\rexemplars of traditional, festive articles.  Furthermore, in\rHeadquarters' Ruling Letter (HRL) 950999, issued April 16, 1992,\rvarious wreaths and garlands, with artificial foliage, were\rclassified in 9505.10.40 as festive articles for Christmas\rfestivities.  Following is the language from HRL 950999 wherein\rCustoms explained which types of garlands, wreaths, etc. would be\rclassifiable in 9505.10 as festive articles for Christmas\rfestivities.\r     \r          Those artificial foliage items which qualify as        \r          Christmas articles of subheading 9505.10 include       \r          wreaths, garlands, candle rings, centerpieces --       \r          complete articles -- made up of foliage commonly \r          and traditionally associated with Christmas [i.e.,\r          artificial poinsettias, pine cones, pine needle \r          leaves, evergreen branches, holly berries, holly       \r          leaves, laurel leaves, or mistletoe (singly or         \r          combination thereof)].  (This largely restates \r          Customs position under the TSUS).  These articles \r          can be further decorated with plastic sleighs,         \r          miniature Santas, glass balls, ribbon, etc.            \r          Stylized/modern versions of Christmas wreaths,         \r          garlands, etc. (i.e., those articles decorated with    \r          neon poinsettias, mauve glass balls, etc.) also \r          qualify as festive.\r\r          At the present time, based on the information before   \r          us, there is no other artificial foliage traditionally\r          associated with any other holiday.  Hence, only\r          Christmas foliage of the type described above is       \r          classifiable in heading 9505.  The rest is classifiable\r          in Chapter 67.\r\r          Note that picks, sprigs, sprays, swags, branches, --\r          incomplete articles -- no matter what they are made of\r          or what flower they represent, are all classifiable in\r          Chapter 67 -- the only exception being mistletoe sprays\r          which are classifiable in 9505.10.\r\r     It is Customs position that the artificial wreaths and\rgarlands at issue in this case are of the type described in HRL\r950999.  Although decorated, because the merchandise is still\ridentifiable and distinguishable as Christmas trees, wreaths, and\rgarlands, it is classifiable in 9505.10.  See GRI 3(b) indicating\r\r\r                               -5-\r\rthat composite goods consisting of different materials or made up\rof different components are classified by the component which gives\rthem their essential character.\r\r     As for the proper classification at the eight digit subheading\rlevel, the articles do not meet the criteria for Christmas\rornaments.  See HRL 950999, supra. \r\r     Subheading 9505.10.40, covers other Christmas articles of\rplastics, while subheading 9505.10.50, covers other Christmas\rarticles made of other materials.  As the trees, wreaths, and\rgarlands are composed of plastic, they are classifiable in\rsubheading 9505.10.40.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The decorated Christmas trees, wreaths, and garlands are\rclassifiable in subheading 9505.10.4000, HTSUSA, as \""Festive,\rcarnival or other entertainment articles,...Articles for Christmas\rfestivities and parts and accessories thereof: Other [than\rChristmas ornaments]: Of plastics.\""  The general column one rate\rof duty is 8.4 percent ad valorem.  \r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director\r                                   Commercial Rulings Division\r\r\r\r\u001A\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1993/953507.doc"",""id"":9371,""rulingNumber"":""953507"",""subject"":""Decorated Christmas trees, wreaths, and garlands; Subheading    9505.10.40, Festive articles, Articles for Christmas    festivities, Of plastics; HRL 950999."",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1993-07-09T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""950999""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""9505.10.4000""]}"
