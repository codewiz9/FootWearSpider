Maloney, Esq.\rRode & Qualey\rAttorneys at Law\r295 Madison Avenue\rNew York, N.Y.  10017\r\rRE:  Footwear, leather, w/removable liners;  Liners, neoprene; \r     Sets;  Uppers, external surface area; T.D. 84-59;  HRL's\r     084013, 086055, 088043, 952170\r\rDear Mr. Maloney:\r\r     Your letter dated December 14, 1992, addressed to the Area\rDirector of Customs in New York, on behalf of Adidas USA,\rconcerning the tariff classification under the Harmonized Tariff\rSchedule of the United States (HTSUS) of leather athletic shoes\rwith removable neoprene liners, has been referred to us for a\rdirect reply.  You state that the country of origin of these\rproducts is not yet determined. \r\rFACTS:\r\r     The samples submitted are two men's high-cut athletic shoes\rreferred to as \""frames,\"" with molded rubber/plastic soles and\ruppers of leather, textile, and plastic.  Both samples have\rfoxing-like bands.  Plastic components of the uppers include\rmolded plastic pieces referred to as \""riemens\"" which are located\ron either side of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and through which the laces are led;\rand a molded plastic strap located at the back of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> in the\rAchilles heel area.  The shoe \""frame\"" contains open spaces on the\rsides and back as well as the tongues of the shoes.  Two\rremovable bootie-like liners made from neoprene laminated on the\rinside and outside with a man-made textile were also submitted. \rThe liners, when inserted into the shoe \""frames,\"" are visible\rwhere they come up higher than the \""frames\"" and through the open\rspaces.  They appear to form part of the uppers.  You state that\rthe liners for these shoes are not designed for or suitable for\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> outside of the shoes for which they are intended.\r\r\r\r                               -2-\r\rISSUE:\r\r     1.   What is the classification of the shoe \""frames\"" [shoes\r          without liners] and each liner, if imported separately?\r\r     2.   What is the classification of the complete shoes [shoe\r          \""frames\"" imported with one pair of liners]?\r\r     3.   What is the classification of shoe \""frames\"" imported\r          with two or more pairs of liners?\r\r     4.   What constitutes the external surface area of the upper\r          of each shoe?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUS is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRI's).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, and, provided\rsuch headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to\r[the remaining GRI's taken in order].\""  In other words,\rclassification is governed first by the terms of the headings of\rthe tariff and any relative section or chapter notes. \r  \r                           QUESTION 1\r\r     In order to respond to this question it is necessary to\rrefer to GRI 2(a), HTSUS, and Note 4(a) to Chapter 64, HTSUS.\r     \r     GRI 2(a), HTSUS, reads as follows:\r\r          Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken\r          to include a reference to that article incomplete or\r          unfinished, provided that, as entered, the incomplete\r          or unfinished article has the essential character of\r          the complete or finished article.  It shall also\r          include a reference to that article complete or\r          finished (or falling to be classified as complete or\r          finished by virtue of this rule), entered unassembled\r          or disassembled.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                               -3-\r\r     Note 4(a), to Chapter 64, HTSUS, reads as follows:\r\r     4.   Subject to note 3 to this chapter:\r\r          (a)  The material of the upper shall be taken to be the\r               constituent material having the greatest external\r               surface area, no account being taken of\r               accessories or reinforcements such as ankle\r               patches, edging, ornamentation, buckles, tabs,\r               eyelet stays or similar attachments[.]\r\r     The tongues of the shoes, even though their sizes and shapes\rare unique, are not considered to be either external surface area\ror accessories or reinforcements.  See T.D. 84-59.  The plastic\r\""riemens\"" on the sides overlay the leather and are accessories or\rreinforcements, as are the plastic areas of the sole which\roverlap the leather \""frame.\""  The plastic straps at the Achilles\rheel area of the back should be considered as external surface\rarea of the uppers because without the liners, they are the only\rmaterial covering that part of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  It is to be noted that\rCustoms has taken the position that the term \""accessories or\rreinforcements,\"" although not fully defined, includes any\radditional material added to an otherwise completed upper as long\ras the underlying material is a plausible upper material, even if\rnot the best material.  See Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL)\r084013 dated March 26, 1990.  This means that the uppers are\ralmost all leather which mandates classification of the shoe\r\""frames\"" [incomplete or unfinished footwear] following GRI 2(a),\rHTSUS, under subheading 6403.91.60, HTSUS, as footwear with outer\rsoles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and\ruppers of leather, other footwear, covering the ankle, other, for\rmen, youths and boys.  \r\r     In HRL 086055 dated January 9, 1990, Customs ruled that\rcertain removable neoprene boot liners were classifiable under\rheading 6117, HTSUS, as other made-up clothing accessories.  \rClassification under Chapter 64, HTSUS, as footwear or as parts\rof footwear was not appropriate because the boot liners did not\rpossess outer soles and they were presumed not to remain in the\rboot after the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> was removed.  Further, the same rationale was\rapplied in HRL 952170 dated December 23, 1992, to classify\rcertain textile booties under heading 6117, HTSUS, rather than\runder Chapter 64, HTSUS, as footwear or as parts of footwear. \rNoting that the instant liners, unlike the liners involved in\rHRLs 086055 and 952170, are not suitable for use other than with\rthe shoes for which they were intended, it is our position that\rthey are classifiable under subheading 6406.10.9040, HTSUSA, as\rparts of footwear, uppers and parts thereof, other than\rstiffeners, other, other, of textile materials other than cotton,\rof man-made fibers.  The textile category number is 669.\r\r\r                               -4-\r\r                          QUESTION 2&4\r\r     When a pair of shoe \""frames\"" and a pair of liners are\rimported together, the external surface area of the uppers of the\rcomplete shoes includes all of the textile areas where the\rtextile liner is the only material covering the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Further,\rtextile will be considered the external surface area of the upper\rin those areas where it is visible and tactile when the tongue is\rremoved, the areas where it comes up higher than the leather, and\rall the places where it is visible and tactile through holes in\rthe leather.  With respect to the two samples, a laboratory\rmeasurement is necessary to determine whether the external\rsurface areas of their uppers is leather or textile.\r\r     If it is determined that the constituent material of the\ruppers of the shoes involved is leather, the shoes would be\rclassifiable under subheading 6403.91.60, HTSUS, as footwear with\router soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather\rand uppers of leather, covering the ankle, other, for men, youths\rand boys.\r\r     If it is determined that the constituent material of the\ruppers of the shoes involved is textile, the shoes would be\rclassifiable under subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUS, as footwear with\router soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather\rand uppers of textile materials, footwear with outer soles of\rrubber or plastics, sports footwear, tennis shoes, basketball\rshoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like, other, having a\rfoxing or a foxing-like band applied or molded at the sole and\roverlapping the upper, other, other, valued over $12/pair. \r\r                           QUESTION 3\r\r     GRI 3, HTSUS, is relevant in determining whether a pair of\rshoe \""frames\"" imported with two or more pairs of liners\rconstitutes a set for tariff purposes.  It reads in pertinent\rpart as follows:\r\r     3.   When by application of rule 2(b) or for any other\r          reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable under two\r          or more headings, classification shall be effected as\r          follows:\r\r          (a)  The heading which provides the most specific\r               description shall be preferred to headings\r               providing a more general description.  However,\r               when two or more headings each refer to part only\r               of the materials or substances contained in mixed\r               or composite goods . . . those headings are to be\r               regarded as equally specific in relation to those\r               goods, even if one of them gives a more complete \r\r                               -5-\r\r               or precise description of the goods. \r\r           (b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different\r               materials or made up of different components, and\r               goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot\r               be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be\r               classified as if they consisted of the material or\r               component which gives them their essential\r               character, insofar as this criterion is\r               applicable.\r\r     GRI 3(b), HTSUS, is germane here because GRI 3(a), HTSUS,\rcannot be used in determining classification.  The Harmonized\rCommodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN) to\rthe HTSUS, although not dispositive should be looked to for the\rproper interpretation of the HTSUS.  See 54 FR 35128 (August 23,\r1989).  EN 3(b)(X) at p.4, provides that the term \""goods put up\rin sets for retail sale\"" mean goods which:\r\r     (a)  consist of at least two different articles which are, \r          prima facie, classifiable in different headings . . .;\r\r     (b)  consist of products or articles put up together to meet\r          a particular need or carry out a specific activity; and\r          \r     (c)  are put up in a manner suitable for sale directly to\r          users without repacking (e.g., in boxes or cases or on\r          boards).\r\r     It is our opinion that a pair of shoe \""frames\"" imported with\rtwo or more pairs of liners meet the criteria set forth above for\rbeing considered a set for tariff purposes.  See HRL 088043 dated\rDecember 24, 1990, and HRL 952170 dated December 23, 1992.  Since\rwe have concluded that the \""frames\"" and liners constitute a set\rfor tariff purposes, it is necessary to determine which component\rof the set imparts the essential character thereto.  EN\r3(b)(VIII), at p. 4, reads as follows: \r\r          The factor which determines essential character will\r          vary as between different kinds of goods.  It may, for\r          example, be determined by the nature of the material or\r          component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by\r          the role of a constituent material in relation to the\r          use of the goods.             \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                               -6-\r               \r     It is our opinion that the essential character of the liners\rand shoe \""frame\"" set is imparted by the shoe \""frame.\""  Although\rthe liner is essential for the practical use of the shoe \""frame\""\r{uncomfortable to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> shoe without liner], its function is\rsubordinate to that of the shoe \""frame\"" which provides a walking\ror running surface which is the primary function of the set.\r\r     It is our position that this set is classifiable under\rsubheading 6403.91.60 or 6404.11.90, HTSUS, depending on the\rconstituent material of the uppers of the shoe as stated above.  \r\rHOLDING:\r\r     Pairs of shoe \""frames\"" imported separately are classifiable\runder subheading 6403.91.60, HTSUS.\r\r     The neoprene liners imported separately are classifiable\runder subheading 6406.10.9040, HTSUSA.\r\r     One pair of shoe \""frames\"" imported together with two or more\rpairs of liners is classifiable as a set under subheading\r6403.91.60, HTSUS, if the constituent material of the upper is\rleather or under subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUS, if the constituent\rmaterial of the upper is textile.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, the visa and quota category\rrequirements applicable to the subject merchandise may be\raffected.  Since part categories are the result of international\rbilateral agreements which are subject to frequent renegotiations\rand changes, to obtain the most current information available, we\rsuggest you check, close to the time of shipment, the Status\rReport on Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an issuance\rof the U.S. Customs Service, which is updated weekly and is\ravailable at your local Customs office.\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories, you should contact your local\rCustoms office prior to the importation of this merchandise to\rdetermine the current status of any import restraints or\rrequirements.\r\r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director \r                                   Commercial Rulings Division \r\r \r\u001A\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1993/953219.doc"",""id"":9208,""rulingNumber"":""953219"",""subject"":""Footwear, leather, w/removable liners;  Liners, neoprene;      Sets;  Uppers, external surface area; T.D. 84-59;  HRL's     084013, 086055, 088043, 952170"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1993-02-09T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""084013"",""086055"",""952170"",""088043""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6403.91.60"",""6406.10.90"",""6404.11.90""]}"

Wortman, Esq.\rGrunfeld, Desiderio, Lebowitz & Silverman\r12 East 49th Street\rNew York, NY 10017\r\r\rRE:  Women's knit garments for lower torso and legs; tights,     \r     heading 6115, HTSUSA, vs. trousers, heading 6104, HTSUSA.\r\r\rDear Mr. Wortman:\r\r     This ruling is in response to your firm's submission of\rDecember 11, 1991, on behalf of your client, Scotch Maid, Inc.,\rrequesting the classification of various styles of women's knit\rgarments for the lower torso and legs which will be imported from\rTaiwan.  Samples of the garments were received by this office.\r\r\rFACTS:\r\r     Two samples were submitted to this office.  The styles\rreceived were 502401, 502301, 732113, 732347.\r\r     All of the garments are made of lightweight, fine knit\rfabric consisting of 55 percent cotton, 35 percent polyester and\r10 percent spandex.  Each garment features a lined gusset in the\rcrotch, 4-way stretch fabric,  and elasticized waist.  The\rgarments vary in length from ankle and capri to bike length and\rvary in the finishing of the leg bottoms.  All have elasticized\rcuffs and some are trimmed with lace.  It is claimed the garments\rwere designed for use during exercise.\r\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Are the garments at issue, Styles 502401, 502301, 732113,\rand 732347, properly classifiable as tights of heading 6115,\rHTSUSA, or as trousers or shorts (depending on the garment\rlength) of heading 6104, HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Customs has received several submissions regarding the issue\rinvolved in this case.  In responding herein, we will attempt to\raddress the various arguments which you have presented and which\rhave been presented to us by others on the classification of\rthese garments.\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRI's).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, provided such\rheadings or notes do not otherwise require, according to [the\rremaining GRI's taken in order]\"".\r\r     In HRL 088454 of October 11, 1991, Customs ruled that\rcertain garments known as leggings are classifiable as pants and\rnot as tights.  Care was taken to point out that while Customs\rbelieves the majority of garments commercially known as leggings\rare classifiable as pants, not all leggings will necessarily be\rso classified.  This caveat was given due to the popularity of\rthe term leggings and the liberal use of that term in the fashion\rindustry and by retailers in describing a wide range of form-\rfitting knit garments for the lower torso and legs.\r\r     In that ruling, Customs examined the meaning of the term\rtights for tariff purposes in great length and concluded that\rtights are garments which are partially underwear and partially\routerwear, partially intended to be exposed and partially\rintended to be covered.  See, Children's Hose Inc., v. United\rStates, 55 Cust. Ct. 6, C.D. 2547 (1965).  Based on the various\rdefinitions which were reviewed, and applying the doctrine of\r\""noscitur a sociis\"", Customs decided that tights are a form of\rhosiery.\r\r     If the tights are a form of hosiery, it becomes necessary to\rdetermine if the merchandise at issue are commonly and\rcommercially recognized as hosiery.  In an effort to properly\rdefine hosiery, Customs has consulted lexicographic sources and\rsought information from the hosiery industry.  Various sources\rdefine hosiery, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\r     1.a. Stockings and socks:  HOSE. b. Chiefly Brit.           \r          Stockings, socks, and underclothing.  2. The business  \r          of a hosier.  Webster's II New Riverside University  \r          Dictionary (1984)\r\r     1.   A collective term for knitted or woven hose, especially \r          women's stockings. * * *  2. A term used in Great      \r          Britain to indicate any knitted article.  Fairchild's  \r          Dictionary of Textiles (1970)\r     \r     Knit or woven coverings for the feet and legs designed to be\r     worn inside shoes, particularly women's stockings and\r     tights; also socks for men, women, and children.  The New\r     Encyclopedia Britannica Vol. 5, at 147 (1975) (found at\r     beginning of discussion of hosiery)\r\rHose is defined as:\r\r     A leg covering, in modern use covering also the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, but\r     formerly sometimes reaching only to the ankle; a stocking or\r     stockings; Close-fitting covering for the legs and waist of\r     the general nature of tights, as formerly worn, often\r     fastened to the doublet by ribbons or strings called points;\r     later, breeches reaching only to the knee.  Webster's New\r     International Dictionary, Unabridged (2nd Ed., 1939)\r\r     A cloth leg covering that reaches down to the ankle and\r     sometimes covers the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>; stocking, sock (a pair of-)- usu.\r     used in pl.; A close-fitting garment similar to tights that\r     covers the body from the waist to and sometimes including\r     the feet and is usu. attached to a doublet by points. \r     Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged\r     (1986)\r \r     1. Stockings, or covering for lower leg and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, usually\r     knit or woven.  Formerly not made to cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  2.\r     Tights, or hose reaching to the waist, formerly fastened to\r     doublet with points.  Mary Brooks Picken, The Fashion\r     Dictionary at 195 (1973)\r\r     The above definitions are helpful, but somewhat imprecise. \rReferences to tights in the definitions do not clarify the issue\rfor Customs as the meaning of tights is also at issue. \rAdditionally, the definition above of hosiery as \""a close-fitting\rgarment that covers the body from the waist to and sometimes\rincluding the feet\"" could arguably describe certain types of\rtrousers.  (See definitions of trousers below).\r\r     The term \""hosiery\"" is a broad one and encompasses a wide\rvariety of products with common characteristics.  To obtain a\rdetermination of the common characteristics of articles regarded\ras hosiery, Customs consulted the hosiery industry for\rclarification regarding the commercial understanding of\r\""hosiery\"".  It is a well-established tenet of customs law that\rtariff terms are construed in accordance with their common and\rcommercial meanings and that the common meaning of a tariff term\ris a question of law.  Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. United\rStates, 7 CIT 178, 182, 585 F. Supp. 649 (1984), aff'd, 753 F.2d\r1061 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  However, whenever the common meaning is\rsomewhat indefinite, \""it is proper to consider the interpretation\rcommonly placed upon it in the particular industry involved.\"" \rUnited States v. Colonial Commerce Co., Ltd., et al., 44 CCPA 18,\rC.A.D 629 (1956).\r\r     The information Customs has received from sources in the\rhosiery industry, such as the National Association of Hosiery\rManufacturers (NAHM), indicates that the industry views\rmanufactured, as opposed to hand knit, hosiery as articles\rproduced on hosiery machines.  These machines are circular\rknitting machines with small diameter heads which produce\rseamless, tubular fabric which is furnished to make stockings,\rpantyhose, tights, socks, etc.  Garments such as those at issue\rherein, i.e., garments which are clearly produced from a cut-\rand-sew process, are not viewed by the NAHM as articles of the\rhosiery industry but as articles of the apparel industry.\r\r     Based on the foregoing information, Customs does not view\rthe merchandise at issue as hosiery.  As heading 6115, HTSUSA, is\rlimited by its terms to articles of hosiery, these garments\rcannot be classified as tights of that heading.\r\r     Since the submitted samples are not classifiable within\rheading 6115, HTSUSA, the other heading which merits\rconsideration is heading 6104, HTSUSA, which provides for\rtrousers or shorts (depending on the length).\r\r     In HQ 089852, dated February 19, 1992, Customs ruled that\rvarious styles of women's knit garments for the lower torso and\rlegs were classified as trousers and not tights.  In that ruling\rparticular emphasis was placed on the fact that, regardless that\rthe garments were designed and marketed as exercise <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, this\rdid not alter or change their classification as trousers.\r\r     Trousers is defined by various sources as follows:\r\r     An outer garment of men or boys, extending from the waist to\r     the knee or, oftener and almost always with men, to the\r     ankle, and covering the leg separately.  Orig. they were of\r     the nature of long hose or tight drawers and were worn esp.\r     by sailors and soldiers.  Webster's New International\r     Dictionary, Unabridged (2nd Ed., 1939)\r\r     A usually loose-fitting outer garment for the lower part of\r     the body, having individual leg portions that reach\r     typically to the ankle but sometimes to any of various other\r     points from the upper leg down, worn esp. by men and boys. \r     The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1983)\r\r     An outer garment extending from the waist to the ankle or\r     sometimes only to or just below the knee, covering each leg\r     separately, made close-fitting or loose-fitting in\r     accordance with the fashion of different periods, and worn\r     typically by men and boys.  Webster's Third New\r     International Dictionary, Unabridged (1986) [Emphasis added]\r\r     Outer garment extending from the waist to below the knee,\r     covering each leg separately.  Worn my men and boys. \r     Formerly very tight, similar to long hose.  Mary Brooks\r     Picken, The Fashion Dictionary at 390 (1973)\r\r     The above cited definitions of trousers indicate that they\rare garments which cover the lower torso from the waist to the\rankle or, sometimes, simply to the knee, and cover each leg\rseparately.  At least two definitions above illustrate that\rtrousers may be close-fitting and form hugging depending on the\rfashion.\r\r     The Explanatory Notes (EN) to the HTSUSA, while not legally\rbinding, constitute the official interpretation at the\rinternational level.  In the absence of clear and unambiguous\rstatutory language to the contrary, it has been Customs practice\rto follow such terms when interpreting the HTSUSA.\r\r     Trousers are defined in the EN to the Harmonized System as:\r\r     garments which envelop each leg separately, covering the\r     knees and usually reaching down to or below the ankles;\r     these garments usually stop at the waist; the presence of\r     braces does not cause these garments to lose the essential\r     character of trousers.\r\rIt is clear from the foregoing that the merchandise at issue\rfalls within the general definition of trousers.\r\r     In deciding if the subject garments are within the eo nomine\rclassification for trousers, Customs may consider the use of the\rmerchandise.  United States v. Quon Quon Co., 46 CCPA 70, 73,\rC.A.D. 699 (1959).   Customs interprets the use of the\rmerchandise to include both the manner as well as the reasons for\rwhich it is worn.\r\r     Customs acknowledges that in this case, the garments are\rdesigned and manufactured for exercise use.  The presence of the\rlined gusset (to wick away moisture during exercise), 4-way\rstretch fabric designed to recover from stretching during\rathletic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and the use of a high percentage of spandex in a\rlightweight knit fabric support such a conclusion.\r\r     As stressed in HQ 089852 regarding similar merchandise:\r\r     We reject the contention that because the garments are\r     designed for use during exercise, dance or other athletic\r     activities that somehow makes them \""more than\"" or \""other\r     than\"" pants.  Sweat pants and sweat shirts are garments worn\r     especially during exercise, but that does not make them\r     \""more than\"" or \""other than\"" pants or shirts.  Garments such\r     as jogging shorts with liners for support, bike shorts with\r     padding in the crotch and liners for support, bike shorts\r     with padding in the crotch and sun dresses with bust support\r     sewn in, clearly possess features which eliminate the need\r     to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> certain traditional undergarments.  These features\r     are not features which generally come to mind when one\r     considers the general class of \""shorts\"" or \""dresses\"". \r     However, the presence of such feature is insufficient to\r     remove these garments from the general class to which they\r     belong, it simply identifies the garments as particular\r     types of shorts or dresses.  Heading 6104, HTSUSA, is not\r     limited by the language of the heading and therefore\r     includes all forms of women's knit pants or trousers.  See,\r     Nootka Packing Co. et al. v. United States, 22 CCPA 464,\r     T.D. 47464 (1935).\r     \r     Customs also recognizes the fact that the garments are\rmarketed through bodywear and exercise departments of major\rretailers.  In Mast Industries v. United States, 9 CIT 549, 552\r(1985), aff'd, 786 F. 2d 1144 (1986), the court in determining\rthat the garments at issue therein, were nightwear, found that\rthe merchandise was designed, manufactured, marketed and used as\rnightwear.  In this case, Customs does not dispute that these\rgarments are designed, manufactured, marketed and used as\rexercise <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  Customs does have problems accepting that the\rgarments are designed, manufactured, marketed and used as tights,\ror that because the garments are used as exercise <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> this makes\rthem classifiable as other than trousers.  We believe the\rgarments have dual uses, i.e., in the gym or on the street.\r\r     In this case, the principal use of this merchandise, whether\rit is for exercise or for fashion, does not affect its commercial\ridentity.  To classify one garment as trousers because it is\rprincipally worn for fashion and a virtually identical garment as\rother than trousers because it is principally worn for exercise\rwould lead to inconsistent classification decisions on\ressentially identical merchandise.\r\r     The submitted merchandise is marketed by utilizing hangtags\rwhich state, inter alia, \""BODY FORCE BODYWEAR\"".  Customs believes\rthat such marketing material does not change the fact that,\rregardless of use, the garments are pants and are considered such\rin the marketplace.   \r\r      We have examined advertising material for garments much\rlike those at issue herein.  For example, similar merchandise\rmarketed by Marx, Marika, Danskin and Jacques Moret.  Customs has\rfound several advertisements for garments by these companies in\rwhich the merchandise is identified as bike shorts, capri pants,\rankle-length pants, knee pants and pedal pushers.  These goods\rhave been identified as such in advertisements for such retailers\ras J.C. Penny, Oshman's, Spiegel and Sears.  Advertisements for\rlocal retailers have appeared in newspapers such as the L.A.\rTimes and the Washington Post identifying these garments in the\rsame manner.\r\r     Garments of the type at issue herein are often advertised\reither before, after, or alongside advertisements for tights. \rBut, they are not advertised as tights or to be worn necessarily \rin the same manner as tights.  Additionally, these garments are\rnot displayed in the manner of tights, folded and packaged, but\rin the manner of trousers, individually hung or hangers.  These\rgarments are separately identified by the fashion industry and\rthis is evident by available advertising material and the manner\rin which the garments are displayed in the stores.\r\r     As stated earlier, Customs does not regard these garments \rin the hosiery category of tights.  On the contrary, these\rgarments fall within an emerging class of merchandise known\rcommercially as \""leggings\"" and worn, in Customs view, principally\ras trousers (or shorts, depending on the length), by women and\rgirls.  This decision is based upon, not only the manner in which\rthe garments are worn, but also the overall appearance of the\rgarments and the manner in which they are displayed and\radvertised in department stores and specialty stores around the\rcountry.\r\r     General Rule of Interpretation 3(a) states that the heading\rwhich provides the most specific description is favored over\rheadings providing a more general description.  The garments at\rissue are properly classified in heading 6104, HTSUSA, as\rtrousers or shorts (depending on the length of the garment) and\rnot as tights of heading 6115, HTSUSA.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     Styles 502401, 502301 and 732113 are classifiable as women's\rcotton knit pants in subheading 6104.62.2010, HTSUSA, textile\rcategory 348, dutiable at 16.7 percent ad valorem.  Style 732347\ris classifiable as women's cotton knit shorts in subheading\r6104.62.2030, HTSUSA, textile category 348, dutiable at 16.7\rpercent ad valorem.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, the visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since\rpart categories are the result of international bilateral\ragreements which are subject to frequent negotiations and\rchanges, to obtain the most current information available, we\rsuggest your client check, close to the time of shipment, the\rStatus Report on Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an\rinternal issuance of the U.S. Customs Service which is updated\rweekly and is available at the local Customs office.\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories, your client should contact the\rlocal Customs office prior to importation of this merchandise to\rdetermine the current status of any import restraints or\rrequirements.\r\r\r\r                           Sincerely,\r\r\r\r\r                           John Durant, Director\r                           Commercial Rulings Division           \r                                              \r\r\r\u001A\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1992/950797.doc"",""id"":7201,""rulingNumber"":""950797"",""subject"":""Women's knit garments for lower torso and legs; tights,          heading 6115, HTSUSA, vs. trousers, heading 6104, HTSUSA."",""categories"":""CLASSIFICATION"",""rulingDate"":""1992-03-31T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""088454"",""089852""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6104.62.2010"",""6104.62.2030""]}"

Robinson International Inc.\r8100 Mitchell Road \rEden Prairie, MN 55344-2231\r\rRE: NYRL B82880 Revoked; “Huggie Heart Shareables” doll \r\rDear Mr. Anderson: \r\rThis is in reference to your March 11, 1998, letter requesting reconsideration of New York Ruling Letter (NYRL) B82880 dated March 14, 1997, issued to you on behalf of Hanover Accessories, concerning the classification of a “Huggie Heart Shareables” doll/ “backpack” under subheading 4202.92.1500, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), as travel, sports and similar bags, with outer surface of textile materials, of vegetable fibers and not of pile or tufted construction, of cotton. A sample and marketing video were submitted for our review.  In preparing this ruling we have considered the information provided in our meeting of April 15, 1998. A notice of proposed revocation of New York Ruling Letter (NYRL) B82880, was published in the Customs Bulletin on March 17, 1999.   The only comment recieved favored the proposal.\r\rFACTS:\r\r\fThe subject merchandise is described as a “Huggie Heart Shareables” doll.  The article consists of a 3 dimensional doll.  The doll exterior surface of the doll is composed of cotton/denim material. It’s arms, legs and heart-shaped head are fully stuffed with fiber fill. The torso is partially stuffed.  The remainder, the back portion of the torso, has a small zippered compartment which provides tote and storage capacity for a variety of separately sold accessories.  The doll measures approximately 1 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> 3 inches long and 1 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> 2 inches wide at its widest part.  The pocket portion of the doll measures approximately 5 inches long and 5 inches wide at its widest part.  Attached to the head and torso of the doll are straps to enable a child to carry the doll on his or her back.  The hang tag on the doll and its accessories reads: “These wearable Shareables are perfect for two.  Share them & <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them on your arms on your legs as a skirt-in your hair.  They can go on your Huggie Heart and also on you!” \r\rISSUE:\r\rWhether the “Huggie Heart Shareables” is classifiable as a doll in heading 9502, HTSUS, or as a backpack in heading 4202, HTSUS?\r\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes, taken in order.  Merchandise that cannot be classified in accordance with GRI 1 is to be classified in accordance with subsequent GRI.  The headings under consideration are as follows:\r\r4202\tTrunks, suitcases, vanity cases, attache cases, briefcases, school satchels, spectacle cases, binocular cases, camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, holsters and similar containers; traveling bags, toiletry bags, knapsacks and backpacks, handbags, shopping bags, wallets, purses, map cases, cigarette cases, tobacco pouches, tool bags, sports bags, bottle cases, jewelry boxes, powder cases, cutlery cases and similar containers, of leather or of composition leather, of sheeting of plastics, of textile materials, of vulcanized fiber, or of paperboard, or wholly or mainly covered with such materials or with paper\r\r9502\tDolls representing only human beings and parts and accessories thereof\r\rIn understanding the language of the HTSUS, the Explanatory Notes (ENs) of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System may be utilized.  The ENs, although not dispositive, or legally binding, provide a commentary on the scope of each heading, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the HTSUS.   See, T.D. 89-90, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).  EN 95.02 states, in pertinent part, that:\r\r...[d]olls are usually made of rubber, plastics, textile materials, wax, ceramics, wood, paperboard, papier maché or combinations of these materials. They may be jointed and contain mechanisms which permit limb, head or eye movements as well as reproductions of the human voice, etc. They may also be dressed.\r\r\fBased upon the ENs, and the article’s physical characteristics we are of the opinion that the  “Huggie Heart Shareables” doll is described by heading 9502, HTSUS. Concerning heading 4202, we are of the opinion that “Huggie Heart Shareables” doll is not described by the heading.  While the doll does have straps for carrying, its  zippered pocket design feature is so small that it may not practically serve as a pack for the child who carries the doll; instead, the practical use of the zippered pocket appears to be to store or carry the Shareables accessories.  As such, this design does not provide sufficient space for us to find that the article’s primary use is that of a “novelty backpack.”   For a full discussion of the classification of “novelty backpacks” see Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL) 958308, dated November 7, 1995.    \r\rHOLDING:\r\rThe “Huggie Heart Shareables” doll is classifiable in subheading 9502.10.00, HTSUS, which provides for “[d]olls representing only human beings and parts and accessories thereof: [d]olls, whether or not dressed; [s]tuffed.\r\rNYRL B82880 is revoked.  In accordance with 19 U.S.C. §1625 (c)(1), this ruling will become affective 60 days after its publication in the Customs Bulletin.\r\rSincerely,\r\r\r\rJohn Durant, Director\rCommercial Rulings Division\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1999/961502.doc"",""id"":16129,""rulingNumber"":""961502"",""subject"":""NYRL B82880 Revoked; “Huggie Heart Shareables” doll"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1999-04-19T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""B82880"",""958308""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""9502.10.00""]}"

A\rsample was provided.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The submitted article consists of a pair of 100% knit nylon\rstirrup socks.  The socks do not have heels or toes and are worn\rover regular athletic socks.  The top 5 to 7 inches of each sock\rare secured in place by a thin, nondetachable strap approximately\r1 inch in width which circles under the arch of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.

Samples of the garments were received by this office.\r\r\rFACTS:\r\r     Two samples were submitted to this office.  The styles\rreceived were 8700R and 9000R.  A third style, 8800R, was also\rmentioned and is claimed to be of the same type as the other\rsamples provided, but the sample was not made available to\rCustoms.\r\r     All of the garments are made of lightweight, fine knit\rfabric consisting of 54 percent cotton, 36 percent polyester and\r10 percent spandex.  Each garment features a lined gusset in the\rcrotch, 4-way stretch fabric,  and elasticized waist.  The\rgarments vary in length from ankle to bike length and vary in the\rfinishing of the leg bottoms.  All have elasticized cuffs and one\rstyle (9000R) features a stirrup.  It is claimed the garments\rwere designed for use during exercise.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Are the garments at issue, Styles 8700R, 8800R and 9000R,\rproperly classifiable as tights of heading 6115, HTSUSA, or as\rtrousers or shorts (depending on the garment length) of heading\r6104, HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\r     Customs has received several submissions regarding the issue\rinvolved in this case.  In responding herein, we will attempt to\raddress the various arguments which you have presented and which\rhave been presented to us by others on the classification of\rthese garments.\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRI's).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, provided such\rheadings or notes do not otherwise require, according to [the\rremaining GRI's taken in order]\"".\r\r     In HRL 088454 of October 11, 1991, Customs ruled that\rcertain garments known as leggings are classifiable as pants and\rnot as tights.  Care was taken to point out that while Customs\rbelieves the majority of garments commercially known as leggings\rare classifiable as pants, not all leggings will necessarily be\rso classified.  This caveat was given due to the popularity of\rthe term leggings and the liberal use of that term in the fashion\rindustry and by retailers in describing a wide range of form-\rfitting knit garments for the lower torso and legs.\r\r     In that ruling, Customs examined the meaning of the term\rtights for tariff purposes in great length and concluded that\rtights are garments which are partially underwear and partially\routerwear, partially intended to be exposed and partially\rintended to be covered.  See, Children's Hose Inc., v. United\rStates, 55 Cust. Ct. 6, C.D. 2547 (1965).  Based on the various\rdefinitions which were reviewed, and applying the doctrine of\r\""noscitur a sociis\"", Customs decided that tights are a form of\rhosiery.\r\r     If the tights are a form of hosiery, it becomes necessary to\rdetermine if the merchandise at issue are commonly and\rcommercially recognized as hosiery.  In an effort to properly\rdefine hosiery, Customs has consulted lexicographic sources and\rsought information from the hosiery industry.  Various sources\rdefine hosiery, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\r     1.a. Stockings and socks:  HOSE. b. Chiefly Brit.           \r          Stockings, socks, and underclothing.  2. The business  \r          of a hosier.  Webster's II New Riverside University  \r          Dictionary (1984)\r\r     1.   A collective term for knitted or woven hose, especially \r          women's stockings. * * *  2. A term used in Great      \r          Britain to indicate any knitted article.  Fairchild's  \r          Dictionary of Textiles (1970)\r     \r     Knit or woven coverings for the feet and legs designed to be\r     worn inside shoes, particularly women's stockings and\r     tights; also socks for men, women, and children.  The New\r     Encyclopedia Britannica Vol. 5, at 147 (1975) (found at\r     beginning of discussion of hosiery)\r\rHose is defined as:\r\r     A leg covering, in modern use covering also the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, but\r     formerly sometimes reaching only to the ankle; a stocking or\r     stockings; Close-fitting covering for the legs and waist of\r     the general nature of tights, as formerly worn, often\r     fastened to the doublet by ribbons or strings called points;\r     later, breeches reaching only to the knee.  Webster's New\r     International Dictionary, Unabridged (2nd Ed., 1939)\r\r     A cloth leg covering that reaches down to the ankle and\r     sometimes covers the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>; stocking, sock (a pair of-)- usu.\r     used in pl.; A close-fitting garment similar to tights that\r     covers the body from the waist to and sometimes including\r     the feet and is usu. attached to a doublet by points. \r     Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged\r     (1986)\r \r     1. Stockings, or covering for lower leg and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, usually\r     knit or woven.  Formerly not made to cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  2.\r     Tights, or hose reaching to the waist, formerly fastened to\r     doublet with points.  Mary Brooks Picken, The Fashion\r     Dictionary at 195 (1973)\r\r     The above definitions are helpful, but somewhat imprecise. \rReferences to tights in the definitions do not clarify the issue\rfor Customs as the meaning of tights is also at issue. \rAdditionally, the definition above of hosiery as \""a close-fitting\rgarment that covers the body from the waist to and sometimes\rincluding the feet\"" could arguably describe certain types of\rtrousers.  (See definitions of trousers below).\r\r     The term \""hosiery\"" is a broad one and encompasses a wide\rvariety of products with common characteristics.  To obtain a\rdetermination of the common characteristics of articles regarded\ras hosiery, Customs consulted the hosiery industry for\rclarification regarding the commercial understanding of\r\""hosiery\"".  It is a well-established tenet of customs law that\rtariff terms are construed in accordance with their common and\rcommercial meanings and that the common meaning of a tariff term\ris a question of law.  Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. United\rStates, 7 CIT 178, 182, 585 F. Supp. 649 (1984), aff'd, 753 F.2d\r1061 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  However, whenever the common meaning is\rsomewhat indefinite, \""it is proper to consider the interpretation\rcommonly placed upon it in the particular industry involved.\"" \rUnited States v. Colonial Commerce Co., Ltd., et al., 44 CCPA 18,\rC.A.D 629 (1956).\r\r     The information Customs has received from sources in the\rhosiery industry, such as the National Association of Hosiery\rManufacturers (NAHM), indicates that the industry views\rmanufactured, as opposed to hand knit, hosiery as articles\rproduced on hosiery machines.  These machines are circular\rknitting machines with small diameter heads which produce\rseamless, tubular fabric which is furnished to make stockings,\rpantyhose, tights, socks, etc.  Garments such as those at issue\rherein, i.e., garments which are clearly produced from a cut-\rand-sew process, are not viewed by the NAHM as articles of the\rhosiery industry but as articles of the apparel industry.\r\r     Based on the foregoing information, Customs does not view\rthe merchandise at issue as hosiery.  As heading 6115, HTSUSA, is\rlimited by its terms to articles of hosiery, these garments\rcannot be classified as tights of that heading.\r\r     Since the submitted samples are not classifiable within\rheading 6115, HTSUSA, the other heading which merits\rconsideration is heading 6104, HTSUSA, which provides for\rtrousers or shorts (depending on the length).\r\r     In HQ 089852, dated February 19, 1992, Customs ruled that\rvarious styles of women's knit garments for the lower torso and\rlegs were classified as trousers and not tights.  In that ruling\rparticular emphasis was placed on the fact that, regardless that\rthe garments were designed and marketed as exercise <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, this\rdid not alter or change their classification as trousers.\r\r     Trousers is defined by various sources as follows:\r\r     An outer garment of men or boys, extending from the waist to\r     the knee or, oftener and almost always with men, to the\r     ankle, and covering the leg separately.  Orig. they were of\r     the nature of long hose or tight drawers and were worn esp.\r     by sailors and soldiers.  Webster's New International\r     Dictionary, Unabridged (2nd Ed., 1939)\r\r     A usually loose-fitting outer garment for the lower part of\r     the body, having individual leg portions that reach\r     typically to the ankle but sometimes to any of various other\r     points from the upper leg down, worn esp. by men and boys. \r     The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1983)\r\r     An outer garment extending from the waist to the ankle or\r     sometimes only to or just below the knee, covering each leg\r     separately, made close-fitting or loose-fitting in\r     accordance with the fashion of different periods, and worn\r     typically by men and boys.  Webster's Third New\r     International Dictionary, Unabridged (1986) [Emphasis added]\r\r     Outer garment extending from the waist to below the knee,\r     covering each leg separately.  Worn my men and boys. \r     Formerly very tight, similar to long hose.  Mary Brooks\r     Picken, The Fashion Dictionary at 390 (1973)\r\r     The above cited definitions of trousers indicate that they\rare garments which cover the lower torso from the waist to the\rankle or, sometimes, simply to the knee, and cover each leg\rseparately.  At least two definitions above illustrate that\rtrousers may be close-fitting and form hugging depending on the\rfashion.\r\r     The Explanatory Notes (EN) to the HTSUSA, while not legally\rbinding, constitute the official interpretation at the\rinternational level.  In the absence of clear and unambiguous\rstatutory language to the contrary, it has been Customs practice\rto follow such terms when interpreting the HTSUSA.\r\r     Trousers are defined in the EN to the Harmonized System as:\r\r     garments which envelop each leg separately, covering the\r     knees and usually reaching down to or below the ankles;\r     these garments usually stop at the waist; the presence of\r     braces does not cause these garments to lose the essential\r     character of trousers.\r\rIt is clear from the foregoing that the merchandise at issue\rfalls within the general definition of trousers.\r\r     In deciding if the subject garments are within the eo nomine\rclassification for trousers, Customs may consider the use of the\rmerchandise.  United States v. Quon Quon Co., 46 CCPA 70, 73,\rC.A.D. 699 (1959).   Customs interprets the use of the\rmerchandise to include both the manner as well as the reasons for\rwhich it is worn.\r\r     Customs acknowledges that in this case, the garments are\rdesigned and manufactured for exercise use.  The presence of the\rlined gusset (to wick away moisture during exercise), 4-way\rstretch fabric designed to recover from stretching during\rathletic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and the use of a high percentage of spandex in a\rlightweight knit fabric support such a conclusion.\r\r     As stressed in HQ 089852 regarding similar merchandise:\r\r     We reject the contention that because the garments are\r     designed for use during exercise, dance or other athletic\r     activities that somehow makes them \""more than\"" or \""other\r     than\"" pants.  Sweat pants and sweat shirts are garments worn\r     especially during exercise, but that does not make them\r     \""more than\"" or \""other than\"" pants or shirts.  Garments such\r     as jogging shorts with liners for support, bike shorts with\r     padding in the crotch and liners for support, bike shorts\r     with padding in the crotch and sun dresses with bust support\r     sewn in, clearly possess features which eliminate the need\r     to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> certain traditional undergarments.  These features\r     are not features which generally come to mind when one\r     considers the general class of \""shorts\"" or \""dresses\"". \r     However, the presence of such feature is insufficient to\r     remove these garments from the general class to which they\r     belong, it simply identifies the garments as particular\r     types of shorts or dresses.  Heading 6104, HTSUSA, is not\r     limited by the language of the heading and therefore\r     includes all forms of women's knit pants or trousers.  See,\r     Nootka Packing Co. et al. v. United States, 22 CCPA 464,\r     T.D. 47464 (1935).\r     \r     Customs also recognizes the fact that the garments are\rmarketed through bodywear and exercise departments of major\rretailers.  In Mast Industries v. United States, 9 CIT 549, 552\r(1985), aff'd, 786 F. 2d 1144 (1986), the court in determining\rthat the garments at issue therein, were nightwear, found that\rthe merchandise was designed, manufactured, marketed and used as\rnightwear.  In this case, Customs does not dispute that these\rgarments are designed, manufactured, marketed and used as\rexercise <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  Customs does have problems accepting that the\rgarments are designed, manufactured, marketed and used as tights,\ror that because the garments are used as exercise <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> this makes\rthem classifiable as other than trousers.  We believe the\rgarments have dual uses, i.e., in the gym or on the street.\r\r     In this case, the principal use of this merchandise, whether\rit is for exercise or for fashion, does not affect its commercial\ridentity.  To classify one garment as trousers because it is\rprincipally worn for fashion and a virtually identical garment as\rother than trousers because it is principally worn for exercise\rwould lead to inconsistent classification decisions on\ressentially identical merchandise.\r\r     The submitted merchandise is marketed by utilizing hangtags\rwhich state, inter alia, \""BODYWEAR FOR BETTER MOVEMENT\"" and the\rrear of the tag states, inter alia, \""This tight has been\rspecially made with Spandex to produce a comfortable fit which\rmolds to and stretches with the body...\""  Customs believes that\rsuch marketing material does not change the fact that, regardless\rof use, the garments are pants and are considered such in the\rmarketplace.   The fact that the rear of the tag refers to the\rmerchandise as a \""tight\"" is no more convincing, as it is a\rmisnomer in classification for the reasons already discussed\rabove.\r\r      We have examined advertising material for garments much\rlike those at issue herein.  For example, similar merchandise\rmarketed by Marx, Marika, Danskin and Jacques Moret.  Customs has\rfound several advertisements for garments by these companies in\rwhich the merchandise is identified as bike shorts, capri pants,\rankle-length pants, knee pants and pedal pushers.  These goods\rhave been identified as such in advertisements for such retailers\ras J.C. Penny, Oshman's, Spiegel and Sears.  Advertisements for\rlocal retailers have appeared in newspapers such as the L.A.\rTimes and the Washington Post identifying these garments in the\rsame manner.\r\r     Garments of the type at issue herein are often advertised\reither before, after, or alongside advertisements for tights. \rBut, they are not advertised as tights or to be worn necessarily \rin the same manner as tights.  Additionally, these garments are\rnot displayed in the manner of tights, folded and packaged, but\rin the manner of trousers, individually hung or hangers.  These\rgarments are separately identified by the fashion industry and\rthis is evident by available advertising material and the manner\rin which the garments are displayed in the stores.\r\r     As stated earlier, Customs does not regard these garments \rin the hosiery category of tights.  On the contrary, these\rgarments fall within an emerging class of merchandise known\rcommercially as \""leggings\"" and worn, in Customs view, principally\ras trousers (or shorts, depending on the length), by women and\rgirls.  This decision is based upon, not only the manner in which\rthe garments are worn, but also the overall appearance of the\rgarments and the manner in which they are displayed and\radvertised in department stores and specialty stores around the\rcountry.\r\r     General Rule of Interpretation 3(a) states that the heading\rwhich provides the most specific description is favored over\rheadings providing a more general description.  The garments at\rissue are properly classified in heading 6104, HTSUSA, as\rtrousers or shorts (depending on the length of the garment) and\rnot as tights of heading 6115, HTSUSA.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     Styles 8800R and 9000R are classifiable as women's cotton\rknit pants in subheading 6104.62.2010, HTSUSA, textile category\r348, dutiable at 16.7 percent ad valorem.  Style 8700R is\rclassifiable as women's cotton knit shorts in subheading\r6104.62.2030, HTSUSA, textile category 348, dutiable at 16.7\rpercent ad valorem.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, the visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since\rpart categories are the result of international bilateral\ragreements which are subject to frequent negotiations and\rchanges, to obtain the most current information available, we\rsuggest your client check, close to the time of shipment, the\rStatus Report on Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an\rinternal issuance of the U.S. Customs Service which is updated\rweekly and is available at the local Customs office.\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories, your client should contact the\rlocal Customs office prior to importation of this merchandise to\rdetermine the current status of any import restraints or\rrequirements.\r\r\r\r                           Sincerely,\r\r\r\r\r                           John Durant, Director\r                           Commercial Rulings Division           \r                                              \r\r\r\u001A\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1992/950798.doc"",""id"":7202,""rulingNumber"":""950798"",""subject"":""Women's knit garments for lower torso and legs; tights,          heading 6115, HTSUSA, vs. trousers, heading 6104, HTSUSA."",""categories"":""CLASSIFICATION"",""rulingDate"":""1992-03-30T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""088454"",""089852""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6104.62.2010"",""6104.62.2030""]}"

Fabric Origin: \r                    U.S. Manufactured in Canada.\""\r                      \r     We note that the upper material is not externally visibly\rcoated with plastic but that the sole material is.  The sole, as\ris, would completely cover the bottom of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  An\rinstruction sheet in one of the shoes provides a template to help\rthe purchaser cut out part of the sole to accomodate the cleats,\rif any, on his bicycle shoe.  Even if this cut out is made, the\rremainder of this item's sole would still cover most of the\rbottom of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.\r\r     Your submitted sample, style 9120, is a lightly lined full-\rfingered glove with a synthetic leather palm, fingers and thumb. \rThe palm is padded.  The synthetic leather, for tariff purposes,\ris a not knitted and non-coated fabric.  The glove also features\ra knit man-made fabric back of the hand and an applied knit cuff.\rThe essential character of this glove is imparted by the\rsynthetic leather portion.  You described this glove as a bicycle\rglove.  The padded palm is typically found on bicycle gloves. \rThe light lining provides warmth appropriate to the activity. \rThe cuff prevents wind from entering the rider's sleeve. \rAccordingly, this glove shows design for use in winter bicycle\rriding.\r\r     Your submitted sample, style 9100, is a half-fingered glove\rwith a padded synthetic leather palm and thumb reinforecement. \rThe synthetic leather, for tariff purposes, is a not knitted and\rnon-coated fabric.  The back of the hand is made of 80 percent\rpolyester amd 20 percent spandex knit fabric, the back of the\rthumb is made of terry.  An off center vent is secured by a hook\rand loop closure.  This glove shows design for use in the sport\rof bicycling.  The essential character is imparted by the\rsynthetic palm and thumb. \r\r     Style 2300 (Skinsuit) is a one piece knitted garment\rspecially designed for the sport of cycling.  The garment, which\ryou state is unisex, is made from 80 percent man-made fiber\r(either nylon or polyester) and 20 percent spandex fabric.  The\rgarment features short sleeves, a zippered front opening which\rextends to a seamed waist and a shorts-type bottom with\relasticized leg opening.  The shorts portion contains a multi-\rlayered padded insert sewn to the crotch and seat area.  The\rinsert consists of an outer layer of chamois which contains a\rpolyester foam core designed for maximum moisture wicking.  The\rinsert's purpose is purely functional, i.e., to pervent abrasion\rand chafing and to absorb sweat while biking.  This is a\rnecessary feature for serious cyclists to enable them to avoid\rthe hazards of the sport.  This padded insert is somewhat\rcumbersome, making the garment too restrictive for everyday <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.\r\r     The applicable subheading for the footwear will be\r6404.19.20, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\r(HTS), which provides for footwear, in which the upper's external\rsurface is predominately textile materials;  in which the outer\rsole's external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics;\rwhich is not \""Athletic\"" footwear; and which is designed to be a\rprotection against water, oil, or cold or inclement weather.  The\rduty rate will be 37.5 percent.\r\r     The applicable subheading for both gloves will be\r6216.00.4600, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\r(HTS), which provides for  gloves, mittens and mitts: Other: of\rman-made fibers: other gloves, mittens and mitts, all the\rforegoing specially designed for use in sports.  The duty rate\rwill be 5.5 percent.\r\r     The applicable subheading for the skin suit will be\r6114.30.3030, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\r(HTS), which provides for certain articles.  The duty rate will\rbe 16.1 percent.\r\r\r     Goods classifiable under subheading 6404.19.20 and\r6114.30.30, HTS, which have originated in the territory of\rCanada, will be entitled to 22.5 percent and 9.6 percent rates of\rduty respectively, under the United States-Canada Free Trade\rAgreement (FTA) upon compliance with all applicable regulations.\r\r     HTS 6114.30.3030 falls within textile category designation\r237.  However, there are currently no quota or visa requirements\rapplicable to products of Canada in this categroy.       \r\r     This ruling is being issued under the provisions of Section\r177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r     A copy of this ruling letter should be attached to the entry\rdocuments filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

This “yarn” comes in coils (reels) of rope-like clusters of 30-555 decitex polyethylene monofilaments grouped together to form a single multifiliment yarn of 27 twist/meter.  Approximately 57 of these multifilament yarns are twisted into the chafing yarn with 12 twists per meter with a final decitex of over 10,000.  This “hank” of yarns is approximately 3/4 of an inch in diameter when taut.\r\rThe “yarn” was classified by Customs as twine, cordage, rope, and cables under subheading 5607.49.2500, HTSUSA, and liquidated under the general column one rate of duty at 25.8 cents/kilogram plus 17.7 percent ad valorem.  The Protestent asserts that this article is properly classified under subheading 5911.90.0040, HTSUSA, as “Textile Products and Articles for Technical Uses, specified in note 7 to this chapter, cords, braids and the like, of a kind used in industry as packing or lubricating material.”  Protestant also asserts that the item is a product of Mexico and is entitled to duty free treatment. \r\rISSUE:\r\r\fWhether the product, identified as \""chafing yarn\"" is properly classified as \""twine, cordage, rope, and cables\"" under subheading 5607.49.2500, HTSUSA, or as “Textile Products and Articles for Technical Uses, specified in note 7 to this chapter, cords, braids and the like, of a kind used in industry as packing or lubricating material” under subheading 5911.90.0040, HTSUSA,\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of merchandise under the HTSUSA, is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI’s) and in accordance with the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI’s may then be applied.  The Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (EN’s), which represent the official interpretation of the tariff at the international level, facilitate classification under the HTSUSA by offering guidance in understanding the scope of the headings and GRI’s.\r\rThe competing provisions which have been asserted as the correct classification for this article are under subheadings 5607.49.2500, HTSUSA, as \""twine, cordage, rope, and cables\"" and 5911.90.0040, HTSUSA, as “Textile Products and Articles for Technical Uses, specified in note 7 to this chapter, cords, braids and the like, of a kind used in industry as packing or lubricating material.”\r\rIn asserting that the product is classifiable under subheading 5911.90.0040, HTSUSA, Protestant relies on Note 7 to Chapter 59, HTSUSA, which states as follows:\r\r7.\tHeading 5911 applies to the following goods, which do not fall in any other \t\theading of section XI:\r\r(a)\tTextile products in the piece, cut to length or simply cut to rectangular \t\t\t(including square) shape (other than those having the character of the \t\t\tproducts of headings 5908 to 5910):\r\r\t*      *      *\r\r(vi)\tCords, braids and the like, whether or not coated, impregnated\ror reinforced with metal, of a kind used in industry as packing \ror lubricating materials;\r\rThe Protestant states that the product is classifiable under heading 5911 because it has met the criteria contained in Note 7, specifically, that the article  be \""1) a textile product; 2) dedicated for technical use; and 3) a lubricating material.\"" \r\r\fProtestant cites Customs New York Ruling (NY) 807398, dated March 10, 1995, as supporting a determination that the subject item is classifiable under subheading 5911.90.0040, HTSUSA, as a lubricating material.  However, we feel that NY 807398 fails to provide support for this proposition and can be distinguished from the subject case.   NY 807398 involved the classification of yarns which had been impregnated with a Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) paste dispersion as well as other ingredients such as graphite, paraffin oil, and silicone oil and it was determined that its principle and sole use was as a \""packing braid\"" used to seal around rotating mechanical shafts in pumps and valves.  In the instant case, the fibers comprising the chafing yarn have not been coated with any substance nor has it been asserted that the subject item is intended to be used as a packing material. \r\rWith regard to technical use, the Protestant has identified this product as \""chafing yarn\"" which is used as \""chafing gear\"" on trawl nets.  According to the Federal Regulations that govern ground fish trawl under the Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 50 CFR Part 663.2(c), \""chafing gear\"" is defined as \""webbing or other material attached to the bottom (underside) or around the codend of a trawl net to protect the codend from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.\""  However,  in Headquarters Ruling (HQ) 957059, dated January 18, 1995, Customs  determined that \""fabric\"" will be considered for \""technical use\"" only if used directly or as a part of machinery or apparatus.  In the subject case, the 6 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> length of loosely twisted rope is attached to the codend of a trawl net.  We do not consider a trawl net as functioning either directly or indirectly as electrical or mechanical machinery.  \r\rContrary to Protestant’s assertion, we do not believe that HQ 955244, dated April 4, 1994,  advocates wide latitude in determining what products qualify under the technical use provision.  Rather, this ruling merely determined that based on the EN’s to 5911, a painting booth designed to clean the air is considered an \""apparatus\"" because it performs a function or executes a task independent from its use as work space.  The filter mat at issue in the ruling was designed for use in this apparatus, and was classified as a textile product for technical use because the EN’s to 5911 specifically state that textile products of the heading are used in various types of apparatus.   In the subject case, the trawl net to which the chafing gear is attached does not have a separate function or task from the work space, i.e., the trawling machinery affixed to the ship has been designed to drag netting from the back of a ship for the purpose of catching fish.  Thus, we do not consider a trawl net as a separate \""apparatus\"" within the meaning of the EN to 5911 and HQ 955244 would  not apply to the product in question. \r\rIn HQ 952938, dated August 4, 1993, the product at issue consisted of a laminated nonwoven material used as a battery separator designed to separate the cathode from the anode in alkaline-electrolyte electrochemical batteries.  The product in this ruling was determined to be an for technical use with an \""instrument\"" (batteries) within the meaning of the EN’s to 5911 because it had been specifically designed and patented to separate substances that chemically react to produce the batteries’ power.  In this ruling, the product has an integral use and is inserted into batteries as they are being produced.  This is distinct from the subject case where chafing gear is separately attached to the codend of a net.   \r\rIt is asserted by the Protestant that the chafing yarn functions as a lubricating material because when it comes into contact with other surfaces or through the action of the water, the yarn strands unravel and the filaments separate from each other forming a protective hair-like mat which functions as a lubricating material that protects the codend from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and abrasion.\tProtestant cites the American Heritage Dictionary in defining a lubricant as “Any of various usually oily liquids or solids, such as grease, machine oil, or graphite, that reduce friction, heat, and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> when applied as a surface coating to moving parts.”  It is argued that the subject chafing yarn is used to reduce heat, friction, and abrasion to the codend as it is towed through the water.  However, it is important to note that the subject product, a loosely twisted textile rope, does not closely resemble the various oily liquids or smooth (untextured) solids, such as machine oil, grease, or graphite, which have been referenced as examples of lubricants in this definition.\r\fProtestant also presents the following definitions in support of the argument that the subject chafing yarn is used as a \""lubricating material\"":\r\rA substance that reduces friction, heat, and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>\rbetween two surfaces.  (The Encyclopedia of Polymer \rScience & Technology, Vol. 8, pg. 325, 1968)\r\rA material used to separate two surfaces in relative\rmotion whose major purpose is to reduce friction \rAnd <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and/or prevent damage.  (Encyclopedia\rof Tribology, C. Kajdas, pg. 184, 1990)\r\rThe Protestant has argued that the definition of \""chafer\"" means to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> away by rubbing, and that \""chafe\"" has an active role; it causes something else to be worn or rubbed away.  Protestant thereby concludes that a \""chafer\"" would be something that wears away or irritates something else by rubbing which distinguishes it from the nautical term \""chafing yarn\"" used to describe a product that prevents <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and friction upon the net, i.e., it does not cause friction or <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, rather it prevents it.  \r\r  Clearly, this product has been designed to provide protection to the net and is used in the fishing industry  for that purpose.  The chafing gear and net have separate functions in that the net catches fish and the chafing gear acts to protect the net from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, much in the same way an elbow patch protects a sleeve.  However, it is our determination that the type of protection offered by this product is not that of a \""lubricating\"" material but as a \""chafer.\""   The word “chafer” is defined in Webster’s 3rd New International Dictionary as \""a strip of fabric covering the head of a tire as a protection from chafing against the rim.\""  In the subject case, once the loosely twisted  rope has unraveled, it forms a fabric-like covering comprised of textile filament strands which protect the codend of the net from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> or \""chafing.\"" \r\rIndeed, the common and commercial name for this product is \""chafing yarn\"" and according to Protestant, the subject product has even been identified as \""chafing gear\"" by the Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration pursuant to 50 CFR Part 663.2(c).  It is also important to  note that there is nothing in the Department of Commerce definition which would suggest that such an article should be referred to as \""lubricating gear\"" or described as a \""lubricating material.\"" \r\rAlthough it was asserted that HQ 085813 (January 10, 1990), and  NY 807398 (March 10, 1995) support the proposition that \""chafing yarn\"" is a \""lubricant\"", the products described in those rulings were classified under heading 5911, HTSUSA, because the primary use was deemed to be as a \""packing material\"" not as a  \""lubricating material.\""  Furthermore, the goods in both rulings contained significant amounts of other nontextile, materials. \r\rProtestant has described the subject chafing yarn as being \""constructed of loosely twisted strands of polyethylene yarn which make up a 3/4\"" rope-like strand.\"" Thus, it is our determination that the subject \""chafing yarn\"" is classifiable pursuant to GRI 1 because it is most specifically described  under subheading 5607.49.2500, HTSUSA, as \""Twine, cordage, ropes and cables, whether or not plaited or braided and whether or not impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber or plastics.\"" \r\r\f The Protestant argues that the classification of chafing yarn under the technical use provision of 5911.90.0040, HTSUSA, is more specific than classification of the product under 5607, HTSUSA, the provision for rope, cordage, and twine.  However, as we have already noted, 5607, HTSUSA, clearly indicates that the heading includes ropes even if they have not been plaited or braided and it is our determination that heading 5607, HTSUSA, is intended to cover exactly the type of loosely twisted rope that is now in question.  In addition, the EN’s for heading 5607 specifically state that ropes which have been produced by twisting are covered under this heading.  Furthermore, it has already been noted that the subject chafing yarn has a final decitex of over 10,000 and the EN’s for Section XI, Table I under General Note(I)(B)(2), at page 781, state that man-made fiber yarns not put up for retail sale, and measuring 10,000 over decitex, are classifiable in heading 5607. \r\rFor reasons already stated above, we do not believe that the product in question is accurately defined as a lubricant.  As such, we do not believe that the technical use provision of 5911.90.0040, HTSUSA, accurately describes the product’s use.  Nor are the cases cited by Protestant applicable in this instance:  Hartog Foods International Inc. v. United States, 15 CIT 475 (1991); and M. Pressner & Co. v. United States, 42 CCPA 48, 49-50 (1954), wherein it was held that tariff headings that address a technical use prevail over an eo nomine provision. \r\rHOLDING:\r\rThe product identified as \""chafing yarn\"" is classifiable under subheading 5607.49.2500, HTSUSA, as \""Twine, cordage, ropes and cables, whether or not plaited or braided and whether or not impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber or plastics: Of polyethylene or polypropylene:  Other: Other, not braided or plaited: Other.\""   This provision is dutiable at the general column one rate of 22.3 cents/kilogram plus 12.1 percent ad valorem.  The textile restraint category is 201.\r\rThe designated textile and apparel category may  be subdivided into parts.  If so, visa and quota requirements applicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.

Maloney\rRode & Qualey\r295 Madison Avenue\rNew York, NY 10017\r\rRe:\tModification of NY G80670; Below the Ankle Hiking Shoe; Not Athletic Footwear; T.D. 92-32.\r\rDear Mr. Maloney:\r\rThis letter is in response to your request dated October 2, 2000, for reconsideration of New York Ruling letter (NY) G80670, dated September 12, 2000, filed on behalf of your client Deckers Outdoor Corporation.  The request concerned the classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA), of two styles, Quest and Casille, of outdoor footwear.  Two samples of the Quest and one sample of the Casille were submitted for consideration.  \r\rAttending a conference with Headquarters personnel on May 14, 2001, were yourself and Mr. Barry McGeough.  Mr. McGeough is an employee of Deckers, and is an expert in the design and production of the Quest and the Casille.  In addition to the in-person conference, a telephone conference was held on June 28, 2001.  Participating in the telephone conference were yourself and Mr. McGeough.  During the conference, it was determined that the style Cassile had undergone several design changes since your request was filed, and that the version of the Casille that was considered in NY G80670, was no longer being imported.  In a letter dated June 29, 2001, you confirmed that the request to reconsider the style Cassile was abandoned.\r\r After review of NY G80670, it has been determined that the classification of the style Quest in subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUSA, was incorrect.  For the reasons that follow, this ruling modifies NY G80670.\r\rPursuant to section 625(c)(1) Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1625(c)(1)) as amended by section 623 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-82, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186), notice of the proposed modification of NY G80670 was published on August 1, 2001, in the Customs Bulletin, Volume 35, Number 31.  No comments were submitted in response to the notice.\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe Quest is produced for both women and men.  It is a low top, below the ankle shoe.  The upper is composed of textile material with overlays that are composed of leather covered with a textile material.  The textile material is designed to resist abrasion and is waterproof.  The uppers are formed on a last similar to the kind used by Vasque to manufacture hiking boots.  The Quest has a hard rubber toe guard over the top of a soft plastic/rubber toe protector that wraps around the front of the shoe.  It has a hard plastic heel counter to which a hard plastic loop is attached enabling the shoe to be clipped to a backpack.\r \rThe outer sole of the Quest is constructed of high abrasion rubber.  This rubber is a hard material that is designed to resist <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  The outer sole has lugs 5-6 millimeters in depth, arranged in a pattern similar to that of a traditional hiking boot.  Between the forefoot and the heel portions of the outer sole at the arch of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, there is a hard thermoplastic urethane material.  This material extends between the outer and inner soles into the forefront of the shoe and into the heel.  This material is a shank that stiffens the sole and protects the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.\r \rThe shoe is secured to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by a system called the Teva Wraptor™ strapping system that is designed to hold the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> securely within the shoe.  This system is designed to prevent the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> from sliding forward in the shoe on downhill surfaces.  The Wraptor™ system consists of a strap that is 7/8th of an inch wide that passes under the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> between the outsole and the midsole through a channel in the thermoplastic urethane shank.  It crosses over the instep of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and is integrated into the lacing system.  The result is that when the laces of the shoe are pulled tight, the shoe is pulled snugly to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> from the bottom, as well as the top and the sides.  \r\rThe midsole is composed of dual density ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) that absorbs shock.  The shoe has a “Shoc Pad” in the heel that is composed of absorbent rubber.  Both of the samples are a size 9.  One sample weighs 18.8 ounces, the other sample weighs 19.8 ounces.\r \rThe Quest is marketed and distributed to retailers that target outdoor activities such as hiking and camping.  The shoe is not sold at traditional athletic footwear retailers.\r\rISSUE\r\r\tWhether the below the ankle footwear under consideration is classifiable under subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUSA, as tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\rClassification under the HTSUSA is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI may then be applied.  \r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, Explanatory Notes (ENs), represent the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level (for the 4 digit headings and the 6 digit subheadings) and facilitate classification under the HTSUSA by offering guidance in understanding the scope of the headings and GRI.  The Explanatory Notes, although not dispositive or legally binding, provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.  \r\r\tIn NY G80670, Customs ruled that the Quest was classifiable under subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUSA, which provides for:\r\rFootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\r\r\tFootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics:\r\rSports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like:\r\r\t\t\tOther:\r\r\t\t\t\tValued over $12/pair\r\rThe Quest, with its below the ankle upper, may appear to be similar to the “athletic” shoes enumerated above.  However, its substantial construction gives it many of the same features present in a hiking boot.  Because hiking boots are not provided for in the Tariff and are classified based upon their constituent materials, it is first necessary to determine if the Quest is classifiable under subheading 6404.11, HTSUSA.\r\rIn Treasury Decision (T.D.) 92-32 (16 Cust. Bull. & Dec. No.16 at 4), Customs responded to the claim of importers that hiking/backpacking boots are “like” athletic footwear and are therefore classifiable under subheading 6404.11, HTSUSA.  Customs rejected this claim, stating:\r \rIn this instance the hiking/backpacking boot, although used in the sport of backpacking, fails to qualify as athletic footwear within subheading 6404.11 because it is not \""like\"" tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, and training shoes.  Specifically, hiking boots are heavier than the listed exemplars of athletic footwear.  This slows the wearer's running speed substantially.  All the exemplars are used in sports which require fast footwork or extensive running.  Additionally, the exemplars are not constructed so as to protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against rough and rocky terrain as are hiking boots.  For these reasons we conclude that the hiking/backpacking boot is not classifiable under subheading 6404.11, as claimed.\r\rEmphasis added.  Thus, it has been Customs position that in order for footwear to be classified as athletic footwear under subheading 6404.11, HTSUSA, it must be constructed for an activity that requires fast footwork or extensive running.  However, it is not necessary that the footwear be principally used for that activity.\u0002\r\rIn Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 953882, dated September 24, 1993, an importer challenged Customs position that because hiking boots are not designed for fast footwork or extensive running, they are not athletic footwear.  The importer argued that three styles of hiking boots were athletic footwear because:\r\r1. The hiking shoes in issue are no heavier than for example, the average pair of a corresponding size of basketball shoes.  In fact, the literature of the GT Max and the GT Rugged specifically state that those styles are \""[l]ightweight shoe[s] designed with an outsole ideal for mountain biking, short distance trail running, or day hiking with lightweight pack.”  \u000B\u000B2. Customs contended that all the exemplars were used in sports requiring fast footwork or extensive running.  The sport of hiking requires fast footwork and/or running -- for example, to cross a hazardous path, to leap across a gap or over a barrier, or to escape the elements or potential danger.  Further, the active hiker/backpacker will incorporate sporadic jogging like running (frequently between one-quarter to one half mile intervals) into their day-long hikes.  \u000B3.  If footwear had to be used in a sport requiring extensive running or fast footwear, in order to fall within the purview of \""like\"" footwear under subheading 6404.11, HTSUS, then footwear such as aerobic shoes would be excluded from that provision.  However, the sporting goods industry in the United States clearly considered aerobic footwear and other footwear not requiring extensive running (e.g., walking shoes) to come within the footwear category known as athletic footwear \u000B\u000B4.  The claim by Customs that the exemplars are not constructed so as to protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against rough and rocky terrain is not correct.  These shoes have characteristics such as carbon rubber outsoles, lugs on outer soles, EVA midsoles, heel counters, heel stabilizers, nylon mesh/leather uppers, removable sock liners, padded heel tabs, padded collars, padded tongues, lateral stabilizer straps, double toe foxings and adjustable width lacings which protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against rough and rocky terrain. \r\u000B\tCustoms rejected the importer’s claim as to one of the boot styles outright.  Customs concluded that the boot, with its distinct heel, over the ankle upper, very thick sole, and steel shank, did not belong in subheading 6404.11, HTSUSA.  Applying its requirement that the shoes be designed for fast footwork or extensive running, Customs had more difficulty classifying the other two styles of boots because, although they were distinct from athletic shoes, they were suitable for short distance trail running.  Ultimately, Customs looked to the differences between the boots and athletic shoes to conclude that they were not classifiable under subheading 6404.11.20, HTSUSA.  Customs noted the following construction designs in reaching its conclusion. \r\r1.  A \""heel\"" stabilizer on the \""in\"" side of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> which extends past the mid point of the shoe; \u000B\u000B2.  stitched and cemented on, molded rubber heel and toe bumpers; \u000B\u000B3. outersoles which are considerably heavier and stiffer (although substantially less so than the usual hiker) and which have a quite different design and spacing for the \""studs;\"" and \u000B\r4. uppers which cover the ankle. \r\rIn HQ 955224, dated March 25, 1994, Customs agreed with the protestant and ruled that a man’s over-the-ankle shoe was not a hiking boot.  Customs found that the shoe was more “like” tennis, basketball, gym or training shoes and was classified in subheading 6404.11, HTSUSA.  In support of his position, the protestant argued that:\r \r1. The footwear is constructed along the same general lines as athletic footwear.  The only real difference is the outersole which is somewhat heavier than some, but not all, jogging shoes.  It is no less flexible, however.  Also, the upper material is waterproof.  These differences are not significant and certainly do not preclude classification as athletic footwear. \r\r2. The footwear is lightweight; it is not heavier than athletic footwear.  Its weight will be approximately 13 ounces (men's size 9).  This is consistent with the weight of athletic footwear.  Tennis shoes, basketball shoes, running shoes and cross-training shoes have weights in this range. \r\r3. The subject footwear is designed for use in activities which require fast footwork and extensive running, specifically scrambling and trial running, although it will be useful in other sports such as mountain biking, hiking and light backpacking.\r\r4. The subject footwear does not exhibit three of the four characteristics cited in HRL 953882 as \""conspicuous differences from training shoes.\""  The subject footwear does not have a heel stabilizer which extends past the mid-point of the shoe.  The subject footwear does not have stitched-on and cemented-on rubber heel and toe bumpers.  The outersoles of the subject footwear are not considerably heavier or stiffer than those typical of training shoes.\r\r5. The subject footwear does exhibit the fourth criteria, uppers which extend above the ankle.  This is not a significant difference from athletic footwear.  It is a fact that aerobic, crosstraining, basketball and tennis shoes are sold in models which cover the ankle.  Accordingly, the fact that the subject footwear has uppers which cover the ankle does not disqualify it from classification as athletic footwear since many exemplars of athletic footwear have uppers which cover the ankle.\r\rCustoms agreed that the footwear, although possessing some features of a hiking boot, was not a hiking boot.  Customs concluded that the footwear was similar enough to tennis, basketball, gym or training shoes, to be included as \""like\"" them.  \r\rThe features looked at by Customs when determining if footwear is athletic footwear classifiable under subheading 6404.11, HTSUSA, are those that affect whether the shoe is suitable for fast footwork or extensive running.  A common feature present in hiking boots is outer soles that are too heavy and stiff for fast footwork or extensive running.  In contrast, athletic footwear have soles that are flexible, lightweight, generally designed for traction on smooth surfaces, and are made of softer rubber.  The outer soles of the Quest (1) are stiff, (2) are constructed of hard durable rubber, (3) have deep lug patterns designed for trail use, (4) have a distinctive heel and (5) are heavy.  Additionally, they have a stiff hard plastic shank that adds to the stiffness of the outer soles.  These features, while good for hiking on trails, make the Quest unsuitable for fast footwork and extensive running. \r\rCounsel submitted marketing materials and independent reviews demonstrating that the Quest is not designed for activities requiring fast footwork or extensive running.  The marketing materials reveal that the Quest is sold at retailers specializing in hiking and camping goods as opposed to athletic footwear retailers. Counsel also submitted reviews from two independent sources that show that the Quest is not suitable for “fast footwork.”  One review appeared in the 12th Annual Gear Guide, dated March 2001, and published by Backpacker magazine. An editor for the magazine who tested the shoe stated:\r\rBuilt like a tank without the weight, these aren’t the most nimble light hikers or the easiest to get your <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> into, but they sure can handle rocky trails.  They offer good traction and great <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> control from the crossover stabilizer straps.\r \r\tThe other reviewer, Outdoor Life Network Television, produced a segment on “light hikers.”  The Quest, along with two other shoes, was selected for testing and comparison.  Three different persons tested the Quest and each had a different opinion of the shoe.  The first person found the Quest to be stable.  The second found it to have good support, that it was stable, not nimble, and advised that one should not expect to take it trail running.  The third reviewer found that the Quest is overdesigned and uncomfortable. \r\r\tThe common thread among all of the reviews is that the Quest is a stable solid shoe.  It appears, however, that the stability of the shoe is at the sacrifice of nimbleness and low weight.  Based on the independent reviews, the Quest’s outer soles are too heavy, hard, inflexible and cumbersome to allow the wearer to engage in any kind of fast footwork or extensive running. \r\rOne factor that is present in traditional hiking boots that is not present in the Quest, is an upper that covers the ankle.  Over the ankle uppers provide ankle support and protect the ankle from sticks and rocks, which are desirable features when hiking.  While the Quest may not have the same ankle support as a traditional hiking boot, the substantial construction of the sole provides sufficient support.  Moreover, the Teva Wraptor™ strapping system, which is designed to prevent the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> from sliding forward in the shoe on downhill surfaces, provides additional stability which helps compensate for its lack of an over the ankle upper.  Although the ankle may be exposed, the Quest is more similar to a hiking boot than to tennis, basketball, gym shoes, training shoes and the like.\r\rWhen determining whether footwear is athletic footwear under subheading 6404.11, HTSUSA, we look at various features including, but not limited to, overall appearance, materials, construction of the upper and construction of the outer sole.  The general appearance and many of the construction features present in the Quest are also present in athletic footwear.  Notwithstanding these similarities, the weight and inflexibility of the Quest’s outer sole makes it more akin to non-athletic footwear.  The Quest is classified under subheading 6404.19.90, HTSUSA.\r\rHOLDING: \r\rNY G80670 is modified.  The below the ankle hiking shoe, referred to as the Quest, is classified under subheading 6404.19.90, HTSUSA, which provides for Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:  Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics:  Other: Other:  Valued over $12/pair.  The general column one rate of duty is 9 percent ad valorem.  \r\rThe classification of the style Cassile in NY G80670 remains unchanged.  However, because the version of the style Cassile now being imported is different than the version considered in NY G80670, it may no longer be classified under subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUSA.  A copy of both this ruling letter and NY G80670 should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.\r\r\rEFFECT ON OTHER RULINGS:\r\rNY G80670, issued on September 12, 2000, is hereby MODIFIED.  In \raccordance with 19 U.S.C. §1625(c), this ruling will become effective 60 days after its publication in the Customs Bulletin.\r\u000B\u000B\rSincerely, \r\r\rJohn Durant, Director\rCommercial Rulings Division\r\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/2001/964625.doc"",""id"":17983,""rulingNumber"":""964625"",""subject"":""Modification of NY G80670; Below the Ankle Hiking Shoe; Not Athletic Footwear; T.D. 92-32."",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""2001-09-10T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""G80670"",""953882"",""955224""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[""G80670""],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6404.19.90""]}"

Samples of each article were submitted for our\rexamination as well as additional information by your facsimiles\rof August 31, 1992, and September 2, 1992.\r\r\rFACTS:\r\r                         HEEL CUP/ANKLET\r\r\r     The heel cup/anklet referred to as a \""Tuli's Cheetah\"", is\rmanufactured in Korea.  The heel cup/anklet is an ankle\rsupporting and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> cushioning device including a stretchable\ranklet having a tubular body fitting over a portion of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>\rof the wearer and extending around the heel area to the ankle\rarea.  The heel cup is made in the United States and is formed\rfrom a relatively soft, flexible material such as molded rubber\ror thermoplastic material.  The exterior is provided with\rprojecting shock absorbing members formed in intersecting ribs. \rIn Korea, the anklet is constructed of an expandable elastic\rmaterial, either synthetic or natural rubber, (e.g., neoprene),\rand attached to the heel cup by sewing.    \r\r     The heel cup/anklet has a resilient body which defines a\rrecess to receive the heel portion of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer. \rThe resilient body is provided with shock absorbing means by the\rintersecting ribs in the heel area.  Additionally, the ankle is\rsupported by the anklet portion which also properly maintains the\rheel cup in a controlled position to absorb shock.\r\r     The heel cup/anklet is intended to be used either by wearers\rwho wish to have the heel cushioned, but who also require precise\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> control and tactile sensation, (e.g., gymnasts), or inside a\rhigh top boot in lieu of a standard heel pad.  This device is\ralso helpful in maintaining the proper position of the heel cup\rat the heel of the wearer in those high top boots which do not\reasily lend themselves to the insertion of a separate heel cup.  \r\r\r                          SOLE CUSHIONS\r\r\r     The sole cushion is manufactured in Korea.  The sole cushion\ris another <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> cushioning device which has a cup-like recess to\rreceive the heel.  The sole cushion has a fully shaped, two color\r\""rubber or plastics\"" (R-P) portion which is made in the United\rStates.  The heel portion of the sole cushion is formed from a\rrelatively soft, flexible material such as molded rubber or\rthermoplastic material.  Like the heel cup, the exterior of the\rheel portion is provided with projecting members formed in\rintersecting ribs.  In Korea, a cut piece of fabric is attached\rto the top surface of the R-P portion to form the sole cushion.\r\r     The sole cushion is designed to be inserted in ordinary\rfootwear to rest under approximately the back 2/3 of the wearer's\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The exterior of the body carries shock absorbing\rprojections extending from the rear of the heel portion at the\runderside of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The projections deform and deflect to\rprotect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by absorbing shock forces on the weight-bearing\rportions of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  \r\r     You contend that the heel cup/anklet and sole cushion are\rclassifiable as orthopedic appliances under subheading\r9021.19.80, HTSUS, with a rate of duty of 5.8 percent ad valorem. \rIn the alternative, you maintain that the heel cup/anklet is\rclassifiable as a body-supporting type article under subheading\r6212.90.00, HTSUS, with a rate of duty of 7 percent ad valorem.\r\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Whether the \""heel cup/anklet\"" and the \""sole cushion\"" are\rclassifiable under the provisions for orthopedic appliances,\rbody-supporting type articles or under other provisions of the\rHTSUS?\r\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Merchandise is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff\rSchedule of the United States (HTSUS) in accordance with the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 states in part\rthat for legal purposes, classification shall be determined\raccording to the terms of the headings and any relative section\ror chapter notes and, provided the headings or notes do not\rrequire otherwise, according to GRIs 2 through 6.\r\r     GRI 2(b) provides that a reference to a material in a\rheading shall be taken to include mixtures or combinations of\rthat material with other materials and that any reference to\rgoods of a given material shall be taken to include goods\rconsisting wholly or partly of that material; if goods consist of\rmore than one material, then classification will be according to\rGRI 3.\r\r     GRI 3(a) requires that where two or more headings describe\rthe merchandise, the more specific will prevail; or if two or\rmore headings each refer to part only of the materials in the\rgoods, then classification will be according to GRI 3(b).   GRI\r3(b) states:\r\r     When...goods are, prima facie, classifiable under two or\r     more headings, classification shall be effected as follows:\r     Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials\r     or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets\r     for retail sale...shall be classified as they consisted of\r     the material or component which gives them their essential\r     character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.\r\r     The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System\r(HCDCS) Explanatory Notes (ENs) constitute the Customs\rCooperation Council's official interpretation of the Harmonized\rSystem.  While not legally binding on the contracting parties,\rand therefore not dispositive, the ENs provide a commentary on\rthe scope of each heading of the Harmonized System and are thus\ruseful in ascertaining the classification of merchandise under\rthe System.  Customs believes the notes should always be\rconsulted.  See T.D. 89-80.\r\r\rI.   CLASSIFICATION AS ORTHOPEDIC APPLIANCES\r\r     Heading 9021, HTSUS, provides for:\r     \r     Orthopedic appliances, including crutches, surgical belts\r     and trusses; splints and other fracture appliances;\r     artificial parts of the body; hearing aids and other\r     appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the\r     body, to compensate for a defect or disability; parts and\r     accessories thereof...\r\r     EN 90.21 reads, in pertinent part, at page 1497, as follows:\r\r                   (1)ORTHOPAEDIC APPLIANCES  \r\r     These are appliances for:\r\r     (i)  Preventing or correcting bodily deformities; or\r     (ii) Supporting or holding organs following an illness or\r          operation.\r\r     They include:\r\r                            *  *  * \r\r     (6)  Orthopaedic footwear, having an enlarged leather\r          stiffener which may be reinforced with a metal or cork\r          frame, made only to measure.\r\r     (7)  Special insoles, made to measure.\r\r                             *  *  *\r\r     (9)  Orthopaedic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> appliances (talipes appliances, leg\r          braces, with or without spring support for the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>,\r          surgical boots, etc.). \r\r                             *  *  *\r\r     The heading does not include: \r\r                             *  *  *\r\r     (b)  Simple protectors or devices designed to reduce\r          pressure on certain parts of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>....\r\r                            *  *  * \r\r     (d)  Mass-produced footwear the inner soles of which have\r          been simply arched to alleviate flat-footedness\r          (Chapter 64).\r\r     In Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 083784, dated May 1,\r1989, concerning the classification of post-operative shoes,\rCustoms stated that the footwear \""...is not a shoe that would be\rworn unless medically necessary....  In addition, these shoes are\robtained by a doctor's prescription.\""  See also HQ 085930, dated\rFebruary 9, 1990.\r\r      In HQ 081639, dated August 25, 1989, discussing the\rclassification of orthopedic appliances, it states:\r\r     The fact that a product is aimed at a medical market does\r     not necessarily establish the medical nature of the product\r     since there may be other marketing considerations involved. \r     For example, a product for which outright medical claims or\r     even hints of curative properties are made can command a\r     higher price in a medical market than in a general one.\r\r     Based on the information provided and our findings in\rprevious rulings, it is our opinion that neither the heel\rcup/anklet nor sole cushion under consideration would be\rclassifiable under heading 9021, HTSUS, as orthopedic appliances.\r\r\rII.  CLASSIFICATION OF HEEL CUP/ANKLET AS BODY-SUPPORTING TYPE\r     ARTICLE\r\r     You maintain that the heel cup/anklet is a brace and should\rbe classified under subheading 6212.90.00, HTSUS.\r\r     Heading 6212, HTSUS, provides for \""[b]rassieres, girdles,\rcorsets, braces, suspenders, garters and similar articles and\rparts thereof, whether or not knitted or crocheted.\""\r\r     The scope of the expression \""similar articles,\"" as used in\rthe terms of this heading, is discussed in the ENs to this\rheading.   EN 62.12 provides, in pertinent part, that this\rheading covers \""articles of a kind designed for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> as body-\rsupporting garments or as supports for certain other kinds of\rapparel.\""  HCDCS, p. 857.  (Emphasis added.)\r\r     In HQ 952201, dated October 26, 1992, Customs determined the\rclassification of a lumbar support belt.  The issue presented was\rwhether this article was similar to a body belt such that it is\rclassifiable under a provision for body-supporting garments, or\rwhether it was classifiable under a residual provision for other\rmade up textile articles.  In HQ 952201, Customs stated that\r\""...while it is designed to support and prevent injury ... the\rarticle in question is not a form of garment, nor is it worn\runderneath other garments....\""\r\r     It is our opinion that this heel cup/anklet is not similar\rto any of the articles specified in heading 6212, HTSUS.  It is\rnot a body-supporting garment as described in EN 62.12. \rTherefore, classification in subheading 6212.90.00, HTSUS, is\rprecluded.  \r\r\rIII. CLASSIFICATION UNDER OTHER PROVISIONS\r\rA.   HEEL CUP/ANKLET\r\r     Other made up textile articles are provided for in Chapter\r63, HTSUS.  Heading 6307, HTSUS, provides for \""[o]ther made up\rarticles, including dress patterns.\""\r\r     EN 63.07 states, in pertinent part, that:    \r\r                            *  *  * \r\r          This heading covers made up articles of any textile\r     material which are not included more specifically in other\r     headings of Section XI or elsewhere in the Nomenclature.\r\r     It includes, in particular:\r\r                             *  *  *\r\r     (27) Support articles of the kind...for joints (e.g., knees,\r          ankles, elbows or wrists) or muscles (e.g., thigh\r          muscles), other than those falling in other headings of\r          Section XI.\r\rHCDCS, p. 868.\r\r     In HQ 952201, Customs classified a lumbar supporting belt in\rthe residual heading for made up textile articles.  Customs has\rclassified other articles in this residual heading.  \r\r     In HQ 951406, dated July 13, 1992, Customs dealt with the\rclassification of knee pads used in construction work, or in\rperforming gardening or household chores.  Two headings were\rpossibly applicable to the type of knee pad used in the home,\rgardening, and the construction industry:  headings 6217 (other\rmade up clothing accessories) and 6307, HTSUS.  Customs\rdetermined that the knee pads were not an \""accessory\"" within the\rmeaning of heading 6217, HTSUS, and classified knee pads not used\rin sporting activities under subheading 6307.90.99, HTSUS, which\rprovides for \""[o]ther made up articles ... [o]ther ... [o]ther\r... [o]ther.\""  See also HQ 951836, dated August 5, 1992.  \r\r     Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the heel\rcup/anklet is classifiable under subheading 6307.90.99, HTSUS, \rdutiable at the rate of 7 percent ad valorem.\r\r\rB.   SOLE CUSHIONS\r\r     As previously stated, we do not concur with your contention\rthat the sole cushion is classifiable as an orthopedic appliance. \r     You did not raise any alternative subheading for this\rarticle.  Based upon our review, we are of the opinion that the\rsole cushions are classifiable in subheading 6406.99, HTSUS, as\rremovable insoles, heel cushions and similar articles.  Exact\rclassification within subheading 6406.99, HTSUS, is based upon\rthe material of which that article is made.  We believe that the\rsample is a \""composite good\"", as defined in GRI 3(b), of the\rtextile and R-P.\r\r     Two conflicting rulings have been issued regarding insoles\rsimilar to this merchandise.  In HQ 086361, dated May 24, 1990,\rwe ruled that the subject insoles were \""of textile materials\"" and\rstated that: \r\r     [t]he insoles ...  [we]re cut from sheets of material which\r     [we]re classified in Section XI, specifically in Chapter 60,\r     and Chapter 56, HTSUSA, they [we]re considered to be textile\r     material for the purposes of Chapter 64, HTSUSA.  They would\r     be classifiable in subheading 6406.99.15..., HTSUSA, which\r     provides for parts of footwear; removable insoles, heel\r     cushions and similar articles; other: of textile materials,\r     of man-made fibers:  other.\r     \r     In HQ 950279, dated December 24, 1991, we ruled that the\rsubject insoles were \""of R-P\"".  We stated that the insoles were\rcomposite articles and the classification is governed by GRI\r3(b).\r\r     Here, as in HQ 950279, it is clear that the R-P, not the\rtextile, imparts the essential character to this item.\r\r     For the reasons stated above, the sole cushions are\rclassifiable under subheading 6406.99.30, HTSUS, as: \r\r     [p]arts of footwear; removable insoles, heel cushions and\r     similar articles; gaiters, leggings and similar articles,\r     and parts thereof...[o]ther...[o]f other materials...[o]f\r     rubber or plastics.\r\rThe rate of duty is 5.3 percent ad valorem.\r\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The \""heel cup/anklet\"" is classifiable under subheading\r6307.90.99, HTSUS, with a rate of 7 percent ad valorem.\r\r     The \""sole cushion\"" is classifiable under subheading\r6406.99.30, HTSUS, with a rate of duty of 5.3 percent ad valorem.\r\r\rEFFECT ON OTHER RULINGS:\r\r     In HQ 086361, dated May 24, 1990, an insole was held to be\rclassifiable under subheading 6406.99.15, HTSUS.  Based upon the\rabove reasoning, it is our position that HQ 086361 is incorrect\rand therefore it has been modified.  See the enclosed copy of HQ\r952864 of this date.\r\r     HQ 950279, dated December 24, 1991, is affirmed.\r\r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director\r                                   Commercial Rulings Division\r\u001A\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1993/952295.doc"",""id"":8846,""rulingNumber"":""952295"",""subject"":""Heel cup/anklet; Sole cushion; Other made up articles;     Composite goods; Subheadings 6212.90.00, 6406.99.15,     9021.19.80; HQs 081639, 083784, 085930, 086361, 950279,     951406, 951836, 952201"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1993-01-05T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""083784"",""085930"",""081639"",""952201"",""951406"",""951836"",""086361"",""950279"",""952864""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6307.90.99"",""6406.99.30""]}"

The pipe comes in approximately 30 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths with outside diameters (OD) from 2.375\"" to 6.625\"" and inside diameters (ID) from 1.815\"" to 5.901\"".  In China, both the outside diameter of the pipe end and the end face are machined to prepare the surfaces for friction welding.  \r\r     The forged steel for tool joints comes in approximately 2 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths.  In China, these materials will be machined by turning the outside diameter and boring the inside diameter.  The finished OD will range from 3.375\"" to 8.50\"" and finished ID will range from 1.75\"" to 4.75\"".  This operation reduces the wall thickness by approximately 5 mm.  The outside diameter of the weldneck (that portion of the pipe near the end to be welded to the 30 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> pipe) is turned down to the same diameter as that of the 30 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> pipe.  Following this process, the tool joint is heat treated, oil quenched and tempered.  Upon completion, the tool joints are threaded, internally for the “box” member and externally for the “pin” member.  The last process performed on the tool joint consists of copper plating the pin and box threads.  \r\r\f     At this point, both the pipe and tool joints are ready for attachment.  This is accomplished by friction welding.  The weld bead (excess metal) is removed and the \r\r                                                                 - 2 -\r\r\r\r\rweld zone is heat treated, air quenched and tempered.  The finished pipe is inspected, measured and weighed, marked, and packed for exportation to the U.S.  \r\r     You estimate that the value added in China is almost 50 percent.  You also advise of two optional processes which may be performed in China which would increase the value to over 50 percent.  The process identified as “hard facing” takes place after the tool joints are heat treated and consists of an application of tungsten carbide or a chromium-rich alloy by tungsten inert gas welding on the tool joint.  The purpose of this operation is to protect the tool joint from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  The other process, if performed, takes place after the drill pipe has been marked and involves the application of an internal plastic coating to the product.  The plastic coating protects the pipe from corrosion and increases its hydraulic efficiency.  \r\rISSUE:\r\r     What is the country of origin of the drill pipe when imported into the U.S.? \r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r \r     Section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304), provides that, \runless excepted, every article of foreign origin imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit, in such manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the \rU.S. the English name of the country of origin of the article.\r        \r     Part 134, Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 134), implements the country of origin marking requirements and the exceptions of 19 U.S.C. 1304.  Section 134.1(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 134.1(b)), defines \""country of origin\"" as the country of manufacture,  production, or growth of any article of foreign origin entering the U.S.         Further work or material added to an article in another country must effect a substantial transformation in order to render such other country the \""country of origin within this part.  For a good of a NAFTA country, however, the NAFTA Marking Rules will determine the country of origin.  \r \r\f     A substantial transformation occurs when articles lose their identity and become articles having a new name, character or use.

In the instant case, the issue to be resolved is whether the Japanese-origin plain end pipe and forged steel for tool joints undergo a substantial transformation as a result of the processing performed in China.\r                                                                 - 3 -\r\r\r\r\r     In Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL) 085575 dated March 7, 1990, aluminum drill pipe from the Soviet Union was imported into a second country where it underwent processing consisting of machining, threading, and hi\u001Eflexing of the tubing and then attachment of tool joints of U.S-origin.  Machining was performed on the ends to ensure concentricity within 0.001 inch, and the ends were then threaded.  The steel tool joints were attached by a process which involved heating to approximately 750 degrees F., screwing on to the tubing, and then cooling with an external water spray.  The cooling process caused shrinkage of the tool joint resulting in a predetermined tightness of fit with the tubing.  Additional processing which included coating the surface of the aluminum drill pipe with an anti-abrasive epoxy material preparatory to use was performed in the U.S.  \r\r     It was noted in that case that removal of one of the components would result in the destruction of the other component.  Thus, the tool joint could be removed and reused, but only upon destruction (machining off) of the tubing; similarly, the tubing could be salvaged and reused, but such processing (heating and cooling of pipe end) would result in destruction of the tubing. \r     \r     In HRL 085575 we concluded that the threading of the plain\u001Eend sections of aluminum drill pipe and the permanent attachment of the steel tool joints resulted in a product that had a character distinct from that of the plain\u001Eend sections of aluminum drill pipe.  Therefore, we found that the aluminum drill pipe underwent a substantial transformation as a result of the processing in the second country.  (See also HRL 082965 (November 30, 1989), where we held that Japanese drill pipe permanently joined by welding with tool joints in France or Venezuela was substantially transformed into a drill string assembly.)   \r\r\f     The facts in the instant case are analogous to the facts in HRL 085575.  After machining, the pipe and tool joint (produced from forged steel) are permanently attached by welding, which involves heat treatment, air quenching and tempering.  Additional processing may include an application of tungsten carbide or a chromium-rich alloy welding to protect the tool joint from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, and a plastic coating to protect the pipe from corrosion.  We find that the processing in China, consisting of machining, boring, threading, heat treating, tempering, oil and air quenching, and friction welding results in a product, a drill string assembly, with a name, character and use distinct from the parts from which it was made.  Accordingly, we hold that the forged steel for tool joints and the drill pipe undergo a substantial transformation in China.  Therefore, the country of origin of the drill string assemblies is China.\r\r\r\r                                                                 - 4 -\r\r\r\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     Japanese-origin drill pipe and forged steel for tool joints are substantially transformed by operations in China which include machining, threading, heat treating, tempering, oil and air quenching, and friction welding.   As a result, the country of origin of the completed drill string assemblies is China.\r\r     A copy of this ruling letter should be attached to the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is entered.

This two piece composite footwear item consists of a removable, mostly textile (but with also some sewn-in plastic surface area pieces) bootie that fully encloses the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and is specifically designed to be worn in combination with a unit molded plastic sandal bottom shell with a plastic outer sole.  The bootie (liner-like) part of this composite unit item encloses the heel, ankle, instep and toes of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> while it also fills in all the open spaces on the external upper surface of its molded plastic shell bottom with mostly textile external surface area materials.  Based on our visual measurements, we are able to determine that this slip-on sandal, which you state will be worn as a single unit of footwear with the bootie part worn over the person’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> while it is also slipped into its design-related and sized plastic sandal frame, has an upper external surface area that is predominately plastic.  We note that you also indicate that the bottom plastic shell portion of this uniquely designed, two sectioned sandal unit can be worn without its specially fitted bootie, but the bootie part of the upper is not made to be worn by itself because it only has a soft “phylon foam” applied sole.  This soft “phylon foam” soling material has a pattern of raised circular surface protrusions to help keep the bootie upper part from sliding around as it sits on top of the grooved and rubber faced footbed on the inside surface of its snug fitted, unit molded plastic sandal-like bottom.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for this item, identified as “Model #BBM782-M8-C1 Men’s Cool Out” will be 6402.99.3040, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear, in which both the upper’s and outer sole’s external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not “sports footwear”; which does not cover the ankle; in which the upper’s external surface area does not measure over 90% rubber or plastics (including any accessories or reinforcements); which is not designed to be a protection against water, oil, or cold or inclement weather; which is of the slip-on type; and which does not have a foxing or a foxing-like band.  The rate of duty will be 37.5% ad valorem.\r\r\tYou state in your letter that you intend to import this slip-on bootie/sandal as a single item set, but in the future you may import the “bootie” part by itself as replacements or to offer the consumer different color options for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  If imported separately and based on the presumption that this textile “bootie” part is not intended or designed to be worn outside of its plastic shell-type bottom, it will be classified as parts of footwear, uppers and parts thereof, of textile materials.\r\r\tTherefore, the applicable subheading for the removable “bootie” portion of this two piece composite footwear item, if imported separately, will be 6406.10.9040, HTS, which provides for parts of footwear, which are parts of shoe uppers that are less than formed uppers; which are of textile materials; and in which (we presume) the man-made fibers present weigh more than the cotton fibers.  The rate of duty will be 5.8% ad valorem.\r\r\tThis removable “bootie” footwear upper part falls within textile category designation 669.  Based upon international textile trade agreements products of China are subject to quota and the requirement of a visa.\r\r\tThe designated textile and apparel categories and their quota and visa status are the result of international agreements that are subject to frequent renegotiations and changes.  To obtain the most current information, we suggest that you check, close to the time of shipment, the U.S. Customs Service Textile Status Report, an internal issuance of the U.S. Customs Service, which is available at the Customs Web site at www.customs.gov.  In addition, the designated textile and apparel categories may be subdivided into parts.  If so, visa and quota requirements applicable to the subject merchandise may be affected and should also be verified at the time of shipment.\r\r\tWe are returning the sample as you requested.\r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

The samples are being returned to you as requested.\r\rThe submitted sample, “Surgeon’s Choice”, is a thigh-length hosiery composed of 72% nylon 28% spandex knit fabric.  You state the stocking will have a graduated compression of 20-30 or 30-40 mm Hg, with the strongest compression being applied to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and ankle, gradually decreasing as the stocking rises.\r\rThe submitted sample, “Boost”, is a calf-length hosiery composed of man-made knit fabric.  You state the hosiery will be offer in two styles “Beginner” which will have a graduated compression of 15-20 mm Hg and “Professional” which will have a graduated compression of 20-30 mm Hg.  The strongest compression being applied to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and ankle, gradually decreasing as the sock rises.\r\rYour letter of inquiry states that it is your opinion that this hosiery would be classified under heading 6115.10.0500 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, (HTSUS) which provides for “Surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.” We disagree with your proposed classification.\r\rYou state they are specially designed, intended and advertised primarily for use in preventing malformations, disease and disorders of the superficial venous system, particularly in athletes and other persons participating in activities.  Surgical graduated compression panty hose and hosiery have a minimum compression of 20-30 mm Hg, are principally used for orthopedic purposes, primarily prescribed by a physician to prevent or correct bodily deformities and the consequences associated with venous disease, and measured and fitted by trained personnel.  The items in question will be sold at medical/surgical supply stores and on the internet, however, the socks are offered in “specific sizes and may be generally prescribed by a physician for patients who require compression but who lead an active lifestyle.”\r\rIn HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, Customs determined that physicians generally recommend graduated compression therapy as a treatment for venous insufficiency.  We further recognized that graduated compression hosiery is generally available in three classes of compression; class I specifically covers a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg.  We found that physicians generally prescribe compression stockings and that doctors indicated that patients generally find the hosiery uncomfortable and do not <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them unless directed by a doctor.   Moreover, letters from medical authorities and conversations with medical professionals confirmed that certified and well-trained personnel must measure various parts of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and leg of a patient in order to obtain a proper fit for the stockings.  We also found that pharmacies and medical supply companies prefer that a patient have a prescription that prescribes the amount of compression and noted that stockings obtained by prescription are often covered by insurance.\r\rThe applicable subheading for styles “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost” will be 6115.30.9010, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for other women’s full length or knee length hosiery, measuring per single yarn less than 67 decitex: other, of man-made fibers.  The rate of duty will be 14.6% ad valorem.\r\rYou specifically propose a possible (secondary) classification of these items under HTSUS 9817.00.96 as articles for the handicapped. \r\rWe do not agree.\u00A0 Headquarters Ruling Letter H131516 KSG, dated March 1, 2011, concerned the applicability of HTSUS 9817.00.96\u00A0 to compression hosiery, especially whether they are worn by those suffering from a physical impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities in terms of \u00A0HTSUS, Chapter 98, Subchapter 17, U.S. Note 4.\u00A0 We find that, regarding these items, as with those items, “It has not been shown that the compression hosiery described above are specifically designed for the use of a person who has little or no mobility.”\u00A0 While that applies to all the items here, it is extra clear for the Boost hosiery, described on the packaging as “Athletic Compression Therapy” and “Training and Recovery Socks for Optimal Performance.”\u00A0 \r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.

Farrow Limited\rFarrow Consulting\r475A Admiral Blvd.\rMississauga, ON L5T 2N1\rCanada\r\rRE:  \tAffirmation of NY N326427; Tariff classification of footwear insoles\r\rDear Ms. Long:\r\r\tThis is in response to your request, dated October 4, 2022, for reconsideration of New York Ruling Letter (“NY”) N326427, issued to your client, Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc., on June 23, 2022.  In that ruling, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) found that the Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles and Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles were classified under subheading 6406.90.30, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”), which provides for “Parts of footwear (including uppers whether or not attached to soles other than outer soles); removable insoles, heel cushions and similar articles; gaiters, leggings and similar articles, and parts thereof: Other: Of other materials: Of rubber or plastics: Other.”  We have reviewed NY N326427, determined that it is correct and for the reasons set forth below, we affirm NY N326427.  \r       \r      \tNY N326427 described footwear insoles at issue as follows:  \r      \rThe Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles and Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles are removable footwear insoles available to men and women in a full complement of shoe sizes.  In your correspondence, you state the insoles are not available in retail establishments and are targeted to patients of podiatrists.  The Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles are constructed in three layers and the Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles, which might be prescribed for those needing additional <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> support, are constructed with an additional foam layer that can be molded.  The base layer of both versions is composed of Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) to provide durability.  The next layer incorporates the OSI Sensory System consisting of multiple pressure and temperature sensors (27-37 sensors depending upon insole size), 6-axis IMUs that utilize accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc., and Cellular and Bluetooth transmitters.  The top foam layers consist of rubber/plastics such as EVA and polyurethane covered with a microfiber lining.  The insoles are packed with charging wires, enabling a weekly or biweekly charge.\r\rWhen the insoles are worn, both versions collect physiologic data such as <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>-time, pressure, step count, orientation, and temperature while the user performs their daily activities.  The data analytics gathered is transmitted via cellular and Bluetooth™ technology to the internet.  Data patterns can be accessed and monitored by phone, tablet, computer, etc., by the wearer and medical professionals with the goal of effective decision-making regarding designing care plans to manage, and to possibly prevent, diabetic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> ulcers and other <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> problems.\r\r      \tIn the request for reconsideration, the requestor argued that the primary function of the sensory insoles is to monitor a user’s physiological parameters, such as plantar pressure, step count, hours of use and temperature, and in turn alert the user to possible injury to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, and that based on this primary function the footwear insoles are provided for in Chapter 90, HTSUS. \u0002  The requestor expressed that this is consistent with the Explanatory Notes (“ENs”) to Chapter 90, which provide in relevant part that Chapter 90 includes instruments and appliances for medical, surgical, dental, or veterinary uses, or for related purposes.  According to the request, the sensory insoles under consideration are registered under the FDA Medical Devices System as medical devices. \u0002  Further, the requestor notes that the sensory insoles meet the terms of heading 9018, HTSUS, because EN 90.18 provides that this heading covers electro-medical apparatus for preventive, curative, or diagnostic purposes, and includes electro-diagnostic apparatus such as diagnostic apparatus incorporating or operating in conjunction with an automatic data processing machine for processing and visualizing clinical data, etc.   Specifically, it is the requestor’s position that the sensory insoles are “other patient monitoring systems” classified in subheading 9018.19.5500, HTSUSA, which provides for “Instruments and appliances used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences, including scintigraphic apparatus, other electro-medical apparatus and sight-testing instruments; parts and accessories thereof: Electro-diagnostic apparatus (including apparatus for functional exploratory examination or for checking physiological parameters); parts and accessories thereof: Other: Other: Patient monitoring systems.” \u0002  \r      \r      \tHeading 9018, HTSUS, is a use provision which provides for instruments and appliances used in medical, surgical, dental, or veterinary sciences, including scintigraphic apparatus, other electro-medical apparatus and sight-testing instruments.  Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS, states that in the absence of special language or context which otherwise requires, a tariff classification controlled by use (other than actual use) is to be determined in accordance with the use in the United States at, or immediately prior to, the date of importation, of goods of that class or kind to which the imported goods belong, and the controlling use is the principal use.  \r      \r      \tEN 90.18 provides, in relevant part:\r      \rThis heading covers a very wide range of instruments and appliances which, in the vast majority of cases, are used only in professional practice (e.g., by doctors, surgeons, dentists, veterinary surgeons, midwives), either to make a diagnosis, to prevent or treat an illness or to operate, etc.\r\r      \tWith regard to instruments or appliances used in medical sciences and classified in heading 9018, CBP’s position is that these instruments include those that have been designed to capture data that directly points to medical diagnoses or physiological parameters needed to diagnose.  See NY N141415, dated January 31, 2011 (classifying a  mobile health system component created for the healthcare industry and consisting of an electro-cardiogram (ECG) device, a blood pressure meter, a peak flow meter (for lung capacity), a pulse oximetry sensor (for blood oxygen saturation), and a digital weight scale, which are all devices designed to measure patients’ vital signs, in heading 9018, HTSUS); NY N289886, dated September 28, 2017 (classifying wearable and reusable sensor patches intended to collect, among other parameters, physiological data such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiration rate, to be transmitted through WiFi or a cellular network for use by medical practitioners, in heading 9018, HTSUS).\r      \r      \tUpon review, we find that the sensory insoles at issue are not classified in heading 9018, HTSUS, as instruments or appliances used in medical sciences.  While the insoles collect data points such as <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>-time, pressure, step count, orientation, and temperature, which might provide information to a medical professional that a further investigation is necessary, these are not physiological parameters that directly point to medical diagnoses.  In this regard, the sensory insoles under consideration differ from the devices at issue in NY N141415 and NY N289886, which were designed to measure vital signs such as blood pressure, lung capacity, blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiration rate, which point directly to a diagnosis of diseases or ailments.  Therefore, we find that the sensory insoles at issue in NY N326427 are not instruments or appliances used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences, of heading 9018, HTSUS.    \r      \r      \tAccordingly, we affirm NY N326427, dated June 23, 2022, which correctly classified the Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles and Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles under subheading 6406.90.30, HTSUS.   \r\r      \t\t\t\t\t\tSincerely,\r\r\r\r\r                                                                        Yuliya A.

Dupont also manufactures a Type 16\r            Tyvek, which is also \""soft structure,\"" but is pin perforated\r            with 10 to 15 mil holes.  Type 16 Tyvek allows for the passage\r            of more water vapor and air than Type 14 Tyvek.\r\r                 The subject garment, Style 2120-1Z, is a one-piece\r            coverall with a zippered front, long sleeves, and a collar.\r            The submitted sample is size extra large.  Style 2120-1Z is\r            also made in sizes small, medium, and large.  The sample is\r            submitted in a plastic bag which contains pictures of a\r            coverall, labcoat, and two piece garment.  The following\r            statement is included on the bag:  \""Quality designed produced\r            and inspected . . . all purpose protective clothing and\r            accessories.\""  The importer, through its attorney, has informed\r            us that the plastic bags are used solely for shipping samples\r            to potential customers and that these packaged samples include\r            different styles of coveralls, whether or not they are made of\r            Tyvek.  The subject coveralls are shipped in cartons in bulk to\r            customers.  Inside the collar of Style 2120-1Z is a sewn label\r            which reads, in part: \""The dimensions of this garment meets or\r            exceeds the requirements of ANSI/ISEA 101-1985\"" [sic].  Durafab\r            states that this coverall is cut larger than standard cloth\r            overalls.  The \""ANSI/ISEA 101-1985\"" is a standard accepted and\r            published by the American National Standards Institute which is\r            intended to provide minimum requirements for finished garment\r            dimensions, labeling, and packaging of men's limited use and\r            disposable protective coveralls.  Garments which meet the\r            requirements of the standard provide the user with an assurance\r            of the minimum level of fit.\r\r                 Texel Industries, Inc., through its attorney, contends in\r            the internal advice request that Style 2120-1Z is classifiable\r            in item 384.9305, TSUSA, which provides for \""nonwoven\r            disposable apparel designed for use in hospitals, clinics,\r            laboratories, or contaminated areas,\"" and not in item 384.9310,\r            TSUSA, which provides for \""coveralls, overalls, jumpsuits, and\r            similar apparel,\"" textile category 659.  The importer claims\r            that classification in item 384.9305, TSUSA, is proper because\r            the garment is specially designed for, and primarily used, in\r            contaminated areas.  Among the most common contaminants which\r            this garment protects against are asbestos, radioactive dust,\r            pesticides, and viral agents which have plagued the poultry\r            industry, such as the Avian flu.  Texel Industries, Inc. states\r            that the subject merchandise is the predominant garment used\r            for contaminant protection in the asbestos work field.  The\r            garment is also used to protect the environment from\r            contamination by individuals, such as in clean room\r            applications and laboratories.  When garments made of Type\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 3 -\r\r            1422A Tyvek are used in clean room environments, they are\r            generally for onetime use, as compared with garments made of a\r            heavy weight Tyvek (Type 1445), which can be recleaned and\r            reused a number of times before discarding.  We are informed\r            that although the subject garment may be used in other than\r            contaminated areas, such as the food handling industry, it is\r            primarily used to protect workers against toxic chemicals.\r\r                 The importer claims that the classification of the instant\r            garment is not governed by Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL)\r            080056, dated August 27, 1987, which determined that a nonwoven\r            disposable coverall made of 100 percent spun-bonded\r            polypropylene was classifiable in item 384.9310, TSUSA, rather\r            than item 384.9305, TSUSA.  The garment in that ruling was not\r            found to be designed for use in hospitals because it had no\r            features which adapted it for that purpose.  The ruling\r            concluded that the garment appeared to be \""multi-purpose\""\r            because similar garments were being imported with different\r            labels indicating non-medical uses such as car maintenance.\r            The garment appeared to serve the overall purpose of preventing\r            one's clothing worn underneath from getting dirty.  HRL 080056\r            also compared the garment to another coverall sold by the same\r            importer.  The other coverall was described as \""identical,\""\r            except that it was constructed of a different nonwoven fabric,\r            and was used for dirty industrial jobs.  The comparison garment\r            was made of spun bonded olefin which was described as \""Tyvek.\""\r            HRL 080056 concluded that the garment at issue could not be\r            said to be designed for use in hospitals because both it and\r            the Tyvek garment had exactly the same design and were claimed\r            to be used for different functions.\r\r                 Texel Industries, Inc. contends that HRL 080056 is in\r            error in determining that Tyvek coveralls are multi-purpose\r            garments.  The importer assumes that Headquarters was not\r            apprised of, and therefore, failed to consider the special\r            properties of both Tyvek and the protective garments made from\r            that material.  The importer also argues that HRL 080056 is in\r            error with respect to its classification of the coverall made\r            of 100 percent spun-bonded polypropylene.  Texel Industries,\r            Inc. reasons that the finding that the coverall could be used\r            in hospitals, clinics, laboratories or contaminated areas\r            indicates that it is suitable for such uses and, therefore,\r            must have been specially designed with particular features\r            which adapt it for those purposes.  The importer's position is\r            that a highly protective special purpose fabric used in\r            manufacturing the subject protective garment is one of the most\r            important features of such a garment, and is evidence that the\r            garment is designed for use in contaminated areas.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 4 -\r\r            ISSUE:\r\r                 Whether the subject coverall is classifiable in item\r            384.9305, TSUSA, as \""nonwoven disposable apparel designed for\r            use in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, or contaminated\r            areas,\"" or in item 384.9310, TSUSA, as \""coveralls, overalls,\r            jumpsuits, and similar apparel,\"" textile category 659?\r\r            LAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r                 Item 384.93, TSUSA, provides for \""Other women's, girls',\r            or infants' wearing apparel, not ornamented: of man-made\r            fibers:  Not Knit:  Other:  Other:  Nonwoven disposable apparel\r            designed for use in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, or\r            contaminated areas [statistical breakout 384.9305]; coveralls,\r            overalls, jumpsuits and similar apparel [statistical breakout\r            384.9310]; . . . .\""\r\r                 Since the subject garment is classifiable in item 384.93,\r            TSUSA, we must further determine whether it meets the criteria\r            for \""nonwoven disposable apparel designed for use in hospitals,\r            clinics, laboratories or contaminated areas,\"" in item 384.9305,\r            TSUSA, which does not provide for a textile category number.\r            If it is not classifiable in that provision, then it would be\r            classifiable in item 384.9310, TSUSA, textile category number\r            659.\r\r                 It is established that the subject garment is nonwoven\r            disposable apparel.  The issue that must be decided is whether\r            it is \""designed for use in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, or\r            contaminated areas.\""  The term \""use in contaminated areas\"" is\r            not defined in the TSUSA, and there is no legislative history\r            covering item 384.9305, TSUSA, since this statistical breakout\r            was administratively created by the \""484(e) Committee,\"" which\r            consists of representatives of the Department of the Treasury,\r            the Department of Commerce, and the International Trade\r            Commission and was established pursuant to section 484, Tariff\r            Act of 1930.  There are also no prior rulings which\r            specifically interpret this term.  The term appears to cover\r            the type of contamination area uses of the subject garment,\r            i.e., radioactive, pesticide, asbestos, and chemical\r            contamination, as well as environments where there is bacterial\r            or viral contamination, such as poultry farms affected by\r            outbreaks of the Avian flu virus.\r\r                 There have been several court decisions interpreting the\r            term \""designed for use\"" or similar language under the TSUSA,\r            and the Tariff Acts of 1913 and 1930.  In United States v.\r            Faber, 7 Ct. Cust. Appls. 406, T.D. 36980 (1917), the phrase\r            \""designed to be worn on apparel or carried on or about or\r            attached to the person,\"" found in paragraph 356 of the Tariff\r            Act of 1913, was interpreted to include only articles that were\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 5 -\r\r            \""peculiarly and specially fitted for being carried on or about\r            the person and devoted to such use.\""  In Plus Computing\r            Machines, Inc. v. United States, 44 CCPA 160,  C.A.D. 655\r            (1957), the court held that the phrase found in paragraph 372\r            of the Tariff Act of 1930, i.e., \""specially constructed for\"" a\r            particular purpose, when used in reference to an article, means\r            that the article includes particular features which adapt it\r            for that purpose.  The court noted that the purpose need not be\r            the sole or principal one served by the article.  The court\r            held that a machine with structural features which served the\r            specific purpose of enabling it to multiply and divide and\r            which incorporated those features solely for that purpose was\r            \""specially constructed for multiplying and dividing.\""  This\r            machine was clearly distinct from one designed for no purpose\r            other than addition or subtraction.\r\r                 In American Astral Corp. v. United States, 62 Cust. Ct.\r            563, C.D. 3827 (1969), the Customs Court held that certain\r            gloves which were shown to be specially designed for use in the\r            game of tennis were properly classifiable as lawn tennis\r            equipment.  Among the factors considered by the court were:\r            (1) the unique features incorporated in the gloves, such as a\r            terry cloth backing and a lambskin palm designed to absorb\r            moisture, which were not found in other types of sporting\r            gloves or dress gloves; (2) the nature of the importer's\r            business; (3) how the gloves were advertised in the trade; (4)\r            the types of stores where the gloves were sold;\r            and (5) how the gloves were packaged.  The court noted that the\r            fact that the gloves had other possible uses did not preclude\r            their classification as sporting equipment.\r\r                 In another sports glove case, Sports Industries, Inc. v.\r            United States, 65 Cust. Ct. 470, 473, C.D. 4125 (1970), the\r            court held that \""whether an article is 'specially designed' or\r            'specially constructed' for a particular purpose may be\r            determined by an examination of the article itself, its\r            capabilities, as well as its actual use or uses.\""  The court\r            found that gloves which were made of a non-porous rubber\r            material were designed for use in the sport of skin diving or\r            scuba diving to protect the hands and to keep them warm, and\r            were therefore classifiable as gloves specially designed for\r            use in sports rather than as other rubber gloves.  The record\r            showed that those gloves were used primarily, if not\r            exclusively, in the sport of underwater swimming, and were not\r            suitable for any other practical use.  In Porter v. United\r            States, 76 Cust. Ct. 97, C.D. 4641 (1976), the court found that\r            certain gloves were specially designed for use in the sport of\r            motocross racing, even though they were not used exclusively\r            for that sport.  One of the expert witnesses testified that\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 6 -\r\r            although the motocross gloves would increase protection in\r            ordinary motorcycle riding, the street rider would find the\r            gloves to be uncomfortable because they offered no protection\r            from the cold.  In addition, another expert testified that the\r            gloves at issue were of the type that would comply with the\r            American Motorcycle Association Motocross Competition Rule\r            Book's requirements for certain protective clothing and\r            equipment, which included gloves.\r\r                 In deciding whether an article is classifiable in a\r            \""designed for use\"" provision, the controlling factor, as\r            reflected in the above court decisions and in HRL 080056 and\r            081415, is whether the article has particular features which\r            adapt it for the stated purpose.  In HRL 081415, dated May 2,\r            1989, Customs determined that certain bouffant-style hats were\r            not classifiable as nonwoven disposable headgear designed for\r            use in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, or contaminated areas\r            because they had no special design features which distinguished\r            them from the same style caps used in other environments.\r\r                   The two main characteristics of the subject coverall\r            which the importer claims are special design features are the\r            use of Tyvek material, which has superior barrier and chemical\r            resistance properties, and the garment's unique fuller-body\r            size and shape.  The latter feature is said to distinguish the\r            coveralls from general purpose cloth coveralls.  Texel\r            Industries, Inc. claims that the instant garment is specially\r            designed to fit loosely over general purpose cloth coveralls,\r            and meets the American National Standard size and labeling\r            requirements for men's limited use and disposable protective\r            coveralls.\r\r                 The evidence presented by the importer indicates that the\r            Type 14 Tyvek used to make the subject coverall has unique\r            properties which make it designed for use in contaminated\r            areas.  Dupont states that Tyvek was developed in 1967\r            specifically as a protective material for hazards like\r            asbestos.  Texel Industries, Inc. has submitted several\r            independent laboratory studies which were conducted for the\r            purpose of determining the specific suitability of Tyvek, and\r            garments manufactured therefrom, for use in protecting workers\r            against specific hazards and contaminants.  The laboratory\r            tests analyzed the effectiveness of Tyvek in protecting against\r            penetration by asbestos fibers, radioactive particulates,\r            fiberglass, and carbaryl pesticide dust.\r\r                 One of the unique properties of Type 14 Tyvek which makes\r            it designed for use in contaminated areas is its\r            impermeability.  The superior barrier properties of Tyvek are\r            attributed to the manufacturing process of bonding the fibers\r            with heat and pressure.  With respect to its effectiveness as a\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 7 -\r\r            barrier against asbestos, studies conducted for Dupont have\r            shown that Type 14 Tyvek blocks the penetration of over 99\r            percent of asbestos fibers that are less than 0.5 microns in\r            diameter.  Tyvek is compared with 1.5 oz. \""air permeable\""\r            SB/Meltblown polypropylene fabric which blocks the penetration\r            of only 73.9 percent of such fibers.  According to Dupont and\r            the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, these\r            small fibers make up a large percentage of airborne asbestos\r            and are the most active in producing cancerous tumors.  With\r            respect to carbaryl pesticide dust, Tyvek 1422A is greater than\r            97 percent effective as a barrier after four hours of\r            pressurized exposure to particles as small as .6 microns.\r\r                 Another property of Tyvek which makes it suitable for use\r            in contaminated areas is its chemical resistance.  This\r            characteristic is attributable to the chemical properties of\r            the polyethylene fibers.  Dupont states that Tyvek is resistant\r            to most organic and inorganic chemicals and inert to most\r            acids, bases, and salts.  It provides splash protection because\r            its continuous polyethylene fibers are non-absorbent and\r            essentially inert.  Dupont supplies a chemical permeation guide\r            for various Tyvek fabrics, which shows the breakthrough time\r            and permeation rates of various chemicals.  Tyvek 1422A, which\r            is an uncoated Tyvek, appears to be most effective against dry\r            particulates such as asbestos and carbaryl pesticide dust.\r            Further protection against hazardous liquid chemicals is\r            provided by coated Tyvek material, such as polyethylene coated\r            Tyvek or Saranex laminated Tyvek.\r\r                 The literature submitted by Texel Industries, Inc. also\r            states that Tyvek's relatively slick polyethylene surface acts\r            as a further barrier against particle entrapment.  Tyvek has\r            high tensile/tear strength in all directions because its\r            continuous fibers are spunbonded in all directions.  It keeps\r            this strength whether it is wet or dry.  Tyvek also has good\r            puncture and abrasion resistance, and is said to stay tough and\r            flexible down to -100 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\r                 Based upon the evidence presented, we find that the\r            importer has shown that the use of Type 14 Tyvek, a highly\r            protective special purpose fabric, is a special design feature\r            of the coverall at issue.\r\r                 Another feature of Style 2120-1Z is the use of serged\r            seams, which is a type of seam commonly utilized in the\r            manufacture of protective apparel.  The serged seams are\r            produced with a rolled edge which exposes fewer needle holes\r            for penetration by small particulates and which also serves to\r            tighten and strengthen the seam under stress.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 8 -\r\r                 It should be noted that although Style 2120-1Z does not\r            have an attached hood or shoe cover, it is usually worn with\r            these separate accessories, which are sold by Durafab and\r            usually taped to the garment.  Durafab does sell another style\r            garment which has attached shoes and a hood.\r\r                 As to the garment's fuller-body size and shape, which\r            makes it designed to fit loosely over general purpose cloth\r            coveralls, we are not convinced that this is a special design\r            feature which distinguishes it from general purpose coveralls.\r            We acknowledge that the American National Standard, which\r            applies to men's limited use and disposable protective\r            coveralls, assures a minimum level of fit.  We are told that\r            the fit of a protective garment can affect safety.  However, it\r            appears that at least some general purpose coveralls are also\r            designed to be worn over other apparel.\r\r                 The importer's statement that the subject garment is\r            accepted and recommended as personal protective apparel by the\r            Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety\r            and Health Administration (OSHA), and the National Institute of\r            Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is further evidence that\r            it is designed for use in contaminated areas.  The OSHA\r            standards with respect to exposure to asbestos and other toxic\r            and hazardous substances are found in 29 CFR 1910.1000-.1500.\r            29 CFR 1910.1001(h)(1) provides that if an employee is exposed\r            to asbestos or the other named substances above the permissible\r            exposure limit set forth in 29 CFR 1910.1001(c), the employer\r            is required to provide the employee with appropriate protective\r            work clothing and equipment, which includes:  (1) coveralls or\r            similar full-body work clothing; (2) gloves, head coverings,\r            and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> coverings; and (3) face shields, vented goggles, or\r            other appropriate protective equipment.  The importer has\r            submitted information from the Mine Safety Appliances Co.,\r            which manufactures and distributes occupational health and\r            safety equipment.  That information, which is provided to\r            customers to help them comply with OSHA asbestos standards,\r            lists disposable Tyvek clothing as one of the \""suggested and\r            acceptable\"" products.\r\r                 In addition to these governmental standards, Texel\r            Industries, Inc. has submitted a portion of the Safety\r            Equipment Institute's Certified Product List for Personal\r            Protective Equipment which mentions the subject coveralls under\r            the section for men's limited use and disposable coveralls.\r            The importer has also submitted Guidelines for the Selection of\r            Chemical Protective Clothing prepared for the U.S. Coast Guard\r            which lists the subject garment, by code, as meeting those\r            guidelines.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 9 -\r\r                 Texel Industries, Inc. has also presented substantial\r            evidence regarding the marketing of Tyvek by Dupont and its own\r            marketing of the subject coverall and other Tyvek coveralls.\r            We find that this evidence further supports the contention that\r            the coveralls are designed for use in contaminated areas.  For\r            example, Dupont states that between 95 to 99 percent of soft\r            structure Tyvek styles are sold directly to apparel\r            manufacturers to be made into protective clothing used in\r            hazardous, toxic, or barrier/clean room environments on a one-\r            time use basis.  Most of the remaining soft structure Tyvek is\r            used in the manufacture of clothing in limited use areas where\r            the concern is to prevent contamination of undergarments or\r            work clothes with substances that are not carcinogenic.  Less\r            than 1 percent of such Tyvek is said to be used for other than\r            safety/barrier purposes.\r\r                 With respect to marketing of the coveralls, Durafab states\r            that it designs and manufactures a broad range of protective\r            clothing and accessories which it sells through safety\r            representatives to distributors.  Protective clothing is\r            defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials as\r            \""any material or combination of materials used in an item of\r            clothing for the purpose of isolating parts of the body from\r            direct contact with a potentially hazardous substance.\""\r            Durafab's engineers and trained personnel specially design\r            garments.  They advise industrial hygienists or other safety\r            personnel employed by end users as to the most appropriate\r            protective garment for a particular job.  The type of material\r            used (such as Type 14 Tyvek, Type 16 Tyvek, laminated Tyvek, or\r            other nonwoven material) and the design of the garment is\r            dependent upon the nature of the contaminant to which the\r            wearer is exposed.  Durafab often designs garments to fit a\r            particular industry.  As noted above, the instant coverall is\r            the predominant garment used for contaminant protection in the\r            asbestos work field.\r\r                 Texel Industries, Inc. has also submitted statements from\r            various health and safety equipment distributors, trade\r            associations, and end users, including federal government\r            laboratories, who agree that Tyvek disposable protective\r            coveralls are well recognized as being designed and well suited\r            for use in the types of contaminated areas described by Texel\r            Industries, Inc. in its submission.  There is a consensus in\r            these statements that Tyvek protective coveralls are generally\r            not used as general purpose garments to protect against dirt\r            and grime, and are not interchangeable with such garments.\r            Most of the submitted statements compare Tyvek garments to\r            general purpose coveralls made of cotton or woven man-made\r            fiber.  Because Tyvek garments do not \""breathe,\"" they are\r            described as extremely uncomfortable, as compared to\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                        - 10 -\r\r            cloth coveralls which are cooler and less constricting.  Due to\r            this factor, a director of a hazardous waste program at a\r            university research institute states that a Tyvek coverall\r            would not be worn unless it was absolutely required to protect\r            against contamination.  One of the supply companies states that\r            although the initial cost of a single Tyvek disposable garment\r            is less than that of a cotton coverall, the cost of purchasing\r            such disposable garments on a routine basis would rapidly\r            exceed the purchase price, combined with the laundering costs,\r            of a reusable garment.  Although these statements compare Tyvek\r            garments to cloth coveralls, some of the comparisons also apply\r            to other nonwoven disposable clothing.  For example, the\r            coverall made of 100 percent spun bonded polypropylene, which\r            was ruled upon in HRL 080056, was air permeable and therefore\r            more comfortable to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> than a garment made of Type 14 Tyvek.\r            Because the polyethylene fibers which compose Tyvek undergo a\r            special heat and pressure treatment process, Tyvek garments are\r            likely to be more expensive than the 100 percent spun bonded\r            polypropylene garments, which are not subject to this process.\r\r                 Texel Industries, Inc. has also presented substantial\r            evidence indicating that its advertising is directed toward\r            protective garment users and is specifically aimed at\r            industrial hygienists and safety engineers.\r\r                 Although the Tyvek protective coveralls manufactured and\r            sold by Durafab, including the instant coverall, are primarily\r            used to protect workers against hazardous or toxic chemicals,\r            these garments are also claimed to meet the design criteria for\r            use in hospitals, laboratories, and other \""clean room\""\r            applications.  Coveralls and two-piece garments made of Tyvek\r            are worn by hospital workers as protection from hazardous\r            chemicals used in patient treatments and in the preparation and\r            application of these chemicals.  The garments also afford\r            protection from chemical waste and human waste.  In addition,\r            they are worn by hospital laundry workers and other hospital\r            workers who clean areas where contaminants are found.\r\r                 We next address the importer's claim that the\r            classification  of the instant protective Tyvek coverall, Style\r            2120-1Z, should not be predicated upon HRL 080056.  HRL 080056\r            found that the coverall made of 100 percent spun bonded\r            polypropylene could not be said to be designed for use in\r            hospitals because it did not have particular features which\r            adapted it for that purpose.  The ruling compared that coverall\r            to another coverall sold by the same company, which was \""of\r            identical configuration,\"" made of a different nonwoven\r            material, i.e., Tyvek, and intended for dirty industrial\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                        - 11 -\r\r            jobs.  It was reasoned that the coverall made of 100 percent\r            spun bonded polypropylene could not be said to be designed for\r            use in hospitals because both garments had exactly the same\r            \""design\"" and were claimed to be used for different functions.\r\r                 We do not modify HRL 080056 as to its result because,\r            based on the evidence provided, we found that the subject\r            coverall did not have particular features which made it\r            designed for use in hospitals.  However, we find that HRL\r            080056 was too narrow in its interpretation of item 384.9305,\r            TSUSA, in that it focused on the similarities in configuration\r            or shape between the subject coverall and the Tyvek coverall,\r            and attached little, if any, significance to the differences\r            between the fabrics composing each garment.  It was evident in\r            American Astral Corp. v. United States, supra, and Sports\r            Industries, Inc. v. United States, supra, that the type of\r            material used in manufacturing a product can be considered a\r            special design feature.\r\r                 In HRL 080056, the importer submitted a sample of the\r            Tyvek material used to make the Tyvek garment.  Our laboratory\r            analysis of the sample reveals that the fabric is a Type 14\r            Tyvek.  The 100% spun bonded polypropylene which comprised the\r            garment claimed to be designed for use in hospitals in HRL\r            080056 differs considerably from the sample Type 14 Tyvek\r            submitted in that case.  First, it is made of polypropylene\r            while Tyvek is made of polyethylene.  However, more\r            importantly, a laboratory microscopic analysis of the\r            polypropylene material indicates that there has been no heat\r            treatment after the spunbonding process.  Thus, the\r            polypropylene material is not subjected to the same heat and\r            pressure treatment as the polyethylene used in Tyvek.\r            Consequently, the 100% spun bonded polypropylene is less\r            durable and is air permeable, which makes it highly\r            \""breathable.\""  In addition, when the polypropylene is wetted,\r            it absorbs water, while the Tyvek does not allow the\r            penetration of water or water-borne contaminants.  Because the\r            garment made of 100% spun bonded polypropylene is permeable, it\r            would not provide the barrier protection needed when the wearer\r            is exposed to hazardous substances or contaminants.\r\r                 A further examination of the Type 14 Tyvek material\r            submitted in HRL 080056 shows that it is thinner than the Type\r            14 Tyvek used to make the coverall in the instant case.  We are\r            informed by our Office of Laboratories and Scientific Services\r            that the thickness of the Tyvek only affects the puncture\r            resistance of the material.  Since both Tyvek materials appear\r            to be equally effective in providing barrier protection against\r            hazardous contaminants such as asbestos, radioactive dust and\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                        - 12 -\r\r            pesticides, we find that HRL 080056 was in error to the extent\r            that it suggests that a coverall made of the submitted Type 14\r            Tyvek material is only for dirty industrial jobs, and therefore\r            is not \""designed for use\"" in contaminated areas.  Literature\r            from Dupont was submitted in HRL 080056 which mentions the\r            varied industrial uses of Type 14 Tyvek clothing.  Most of\r            those uses relate to safety applications, such as use with\r            asbestos, radioactive contaminants, lead dust, PCB, and\r            pesticide sprays. The literature also mentions use of Type 14\r            Tyvek for dirty job applications, such as for spray painting,\r            sandblasting, and routine inspection.  Type 16 Tyvek, which is\r            of microporous construction, thereby allowing the fabric to\r            breathe, is generally indicated for dirty job applications.\r\r                 We also find that HRL 080056 was in error to the extent\r            that it infers that a garment which has multiple uses cannot be\r            considered \""designed for use in hospitals, clinics,\r            laboratories, or contaminated areas.\""  The fact that a garment\r            could be used in general industrial, business, or home\r            environments, as well as in hospitals, should not be the\r            determinative factor in deciding that it is not classifiable in\r            item 384.9305, TSUSA.  As discussed above, in American Astral\r            Corp. v. United States, 62 Cust. Ct. 563 (1969), the Customs\r            Court found that the fact that the subject glove had possible\r            uses other than in the game of tennis did not preclude its\r            classification as sporting equipment.  In Plus Computing\r            Machines, Inc. v. United States, supra, the court held that the\r            phrase \""specially constructed for\"" a particular purpose did not\r            mean that that purpose must be the sole or principal one served\r            by the article.  As stated in HRL 081415, the controlling\r            factor is whether the article has design features which\r            peculiarly adapt it for use in the environments specified in\r            the applicable tariff provision.  If such features exist, the\r            fact that the article can conceivably be used, and is used, in\r            other environments does not negate a finding that it is\r            \""designed for use\"" in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, or\r            contaminated areas.  We, however, disagree with Texel\r            Industries, Inc.'s contention that actual use of the subject\r            garment in contaminated areas leads to a presumption that the\r            garment is designed for use in such areas.  An importer has the\r            burden of showing that the article has special design features\r            which adapt it to those uses.\r\r                 We find that the importer, Texel Industries, Inc., has met\r            that burden based on the evidence summarized above.  In\r            addition to the special design features, the importer has shown\r            that the marketing, advertising, and sale of the garment are\r            all directed toward uses which qualify as \""contaminated areas,\""\r            as that term is used in item 384.9305, TSUSA.  Therefore, the\r            subject coverall is found to be \""designed for use\"" in\r            contaminated areas for purposes of classification in item\r            384.9305, TSUSA.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                        - 13 -\r\r            HOLDING:\r\r                 For the foregoing reasons, the subject coverall, Style\r            2120-1Z, is classifiable in item 384.9305, TSUSA.  The 1988\r            rate of duty is 17 percent ad valorem.  Under the Harmonized\r            Tariff Schedule of the United States, this coverall is\r            classifiable in subheading 6210.10.4010, which provides for\r            \""nonwoven disposable apparel designed for use in hospitals,\r            clinics, laboratories, or contaminated areas.\""  Our ruling is\r            limited to this coverall, which is made of Type 14 Tyvek, and\r            would not apply to a coverall made of Type 16 Tyvek which\r            allows the penetration of certain contaminants.

The primary components of hermetic compressors are the stator, rotor, housing, crankcase, crankshaft, piston, piston pin, connecting rod, internal discharge tube, oil pump, valve components, nameplate, and cover. Additional components incorporated during assembly include, but are not limited to, screws, washers, wire, gaskets, and ball bearings.\r\rThe shell of the compressor is constructed from steel sheet. The top portion is welded to the bottom portion, creating a hermetically sealed connection which prevents refrigerant from leaking to the outside. The stator is a lamination stack of steel sheet together with two windings of copper wires. The rotor is a lamination stack that is cast in aluminum. The crankshaft is connected to the rotor and transmits the rotation of the motor into reciprocating strokes of the piston. As a result, the cylinder moves up and down and allows refrigerant to be drawn in, compressed, and discharged. Refrigerant is pulled into the compressor through a suction connector, and it is routed out by a discharge connector. Valves assist with opening and closing the valve plates during the suction and discharge actions. In addition, the compressors are fitted with internal springs to reduce vibration and a muffler to reduce noise.\r\rAssembly of the hermetic compressors will occur in Mexico of mostly Chinese origin components, with the exception of aluminum ingot purchased in Mexico but sourced from India, assembly oil sourced from the U.S., and packing materials sourced from Mexico. Of note, the stators and rotors will be manufactured in Mexico from Chinese-origin materials. The mechanical unit consisting of the motor, cylinder, and valves will be assembled into the bottom housing in Mexico. In your submission, you state the manufacturing process requires several trained employees and various machinery to complete 86 separate operations that cover the stator, rotor, lower housing, and compressor.\r\rStator production begins with the loading of steel lamination sheet into the feeder of a lamination stacker machine to produce a lamination stack to specifications. The formed lamination stack is placed on a transfer rack where slot insulation of polyester film is inserted into 24 slots on the lamination stack. A main coil winding machine places the main phase winding of enameled wire and inserts the main winding into the lamination slots. In the first forming process, a coil forming machine forms the main winding ends to a specified sharpness. The winding is then manually checked by an employee for indentations and wedge integrity and a lead wire is placed into the correct location. Next, an employee winds the auxiliary winding into the lamination stack using an auxiliary winding machine. A laser marking machine marks the lamination stack with the stator model number, production date, and serial number.\r\rDuring the second forming process, a coil forming machine forms the auxiliary winding. After that, an employee crimps the main, auxiliary and common ends of the stator together with the wire harness using a crimping machine. An employee assembles the heat shrink tubes and manually covers the crimped terminal ends. Four employees complete the lead finishing by manually sorting outgoing lines and inserting them into the windings. In the third forming process, a coil forming machine starts to form the winding ends of the stator. Following that, two lacing machines lace the winding ends. In final forming, the stator is put into reshaping tooling of a coil forming machine to reshape the winding end size. Using an inner hole rolling machine, burrs from the stator hole are rolled and removed. \u00A0After final shaping, four employees perform visual inspection of the stator for defects. Finally, an employee performs several tests for quality assurance and places the qualified stator in a storage box.\r\rCentrifugal casting rotor production begins with an employee attaching a cap to a rotor lamination stack and placing it on a conveyor belt of the production line. The following step is the centrifugal casting process in which the rotor lamination stack is heated to 320 degrees Centigrade. Using an aluminum melting furnace and a centrifugal casting machine, liquid aluminum is poured into the lamination stack rotating at high speed. Pouring the aluminum in this manner allows it to fill the lamination slots and solidify under the action of centrifugal force. Utilizing a combined processing machine and a roller, the centrifugally cast rotor is air cooled and undergoes processing such as removal of the casting port, marking, and inner hole rolling. In the last step of rotor production, an employee performs a waveform test utilizing a waveform detector and places the qualified rotor in a storage box.\r\rThe lower housing welding line begins with an employee taking a lower compressor housing from its storage location and placing it on the production line. Then, an employee welds four ejector pins and two <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> plates to the lower housing. Employees weld the process tube, suction tube, and discharge tube to the housing in succession and position each to the upper electrode. The hermetic terminal and terminal fence are then welded to the lower housing. Following that, the inner discharge tube is bent as required and the lower housing is laser marked using a laser marking machine. In the final step, an employee installs an insulation sheet onto the hermetic terminal as specified.\r\rThe compressor production line is comprised of three different lines connected to each other with a transfer mechanism. First, an employee loads a crankcase onto a fixed board in the assembly line and brushes and cleans the piston hole. After measuring the piston hole diameter, an employee selects an appropriately sized piston, measures the fit clearance, and inserts it into the crankcase using an air gauge. Washers and ball bearings are attached to the crankcase using a bearing assembly machine. After measuring the crankshaft hole, an employee selects the correct crankshaft, applies assembly oil, and inserts it into the crankcase.\r\rNext, an employee selects the correct connecting rod and piston pin and assembles them using an air gauge. An elastic pin is then placed inside the piston and piston pin. A machine presses the elastic pin into final position and adds an appropriate amount of assembly oil to the connecting rod and piston surface. Subsequently, four employees pre-assemble the valve group by manually connecting the cylinder head, gasket, valve plate, security clip, suction motor, and suction valve with four screws. Once measurements are obtained, a gasket selection machine selects the corresponding valve plate gasket and uses a manipulator to place it on the crank case.\r\rThe selected valve plate gasket and pre-assembled valve group is manually put together by an employee and then pre-tightened using a cylinder head pre-tightening machine. Four screws of the cylinder head are then finely tightened using four torque machines. At this point, a robot turns the mechanical kit upside down and places it on the tooling plate of the next assembly line. Insulation sheets are placed on the crankcase using an insulation sheet placement machine. An employee takes a stator from the storage location and assembles screws and washers to the stator. Measurements are taken to ensure specific axial clearance between the crankshaft and crankcase.\r\rThen, two employees heat a rotor in an inductive heating furnace to expand the rotor’s inner hole diameter. Once appropriately heated, the rotor is inserted into the crankshaft using specialized tooling. The rotor is then cooled using an air curtain machine to 120 degrees Centigrade. Thereafter, an employee verifies the airgap clearance between the stator and rotor using an axial clearance feeler. Using an insert machine, the oil pick-up is inserted into the crankshaft hole and pressed into place. Four upper springs are fitted to the head of the stator screws. A machine then presses the support spring and the lower spring sleeve together and presses the assembled components to the lower housing. A robot moves the mechanical kit into the lower housing.\r\rAn employee assembles the motor wiring harness to the hermetic terminal and places a gasket on the discharge chamber. The inner discharge tube is taken from its storage location and placed on the compressor crankcase. A screw is placed on the internal discharge tube, and it is attached to the discharge chamber of the crankcase using a torque gun. Then, an employee welds the internal discharge tube to the inner discharge using a welding machine. After checking the compressor pump position, impurities are removed using a dust blower and vacuum cleaner. The height of the compressor pump in the lower housing is checked, and further testing is conducted for electrical strength, performance, and pressure leakage. An employee places the upper housing onto the lower housing to verify height clearance. Following that, the upper housing is laser marked with a serial number and the upper and lower housings are welded together.\r\rUsing a machine, the process tube, suction tube, and discharge tube are bent according to the required angle. The compressor then undergoes additional leakage testing using compressed air in a water tank test. After surface painting in an electrophoresis paint oven, the compressor is sent via conveyor to a drying furnace for 90-120 minutes of heating to cure the paint. The final processes consist of vacuuming the compressor to remove moisture, oil charging, rubber plug and grommet installation, and labeling. Employees perform final benchmark testing and visual inspection, and the finished compressor is placed by a stacking robot for packaging.\r\rIn addition to the manufacturing and assembly processes, the hermetic compressors undergo individual benchmark tests for quality assurance. In the “<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> test,” the compressor is run for a period of time under hard operating conditions such as high pressure. For the “on/off test,” the compressor undergoes a large number of “start/stop inputs” to evaluate the fatigue of the elastic suspension and shock-loop tube. In the “high-temperature test,” the compressor is operated for a long duration with the motor windings artificially heated to abnormally high values. This test is used to evaluate the lubricating oil, refrigerant, metals, and to identify traces of material used in manufacturing.\r\rIn your letter, you suggest the three hermetic compressor models are classified in subheading 8414.30, HTSUS, which provides for Air or vacuum pumps, air or other gas compressors and fans; ventilating or recycling hoods incorporating a fan, whether or not fitted with filters; gas-tight biological safety cabinets, whether or not fitted with filters; parts thereof: Compressors of a kind used in refrigerating equipment (including air conditioning).\rEligibility for preferential treatment under the USMCA:\r\rIn your letter, you inquire whether the hermetic compressors are eligible for preferential treatment under the USMCA. The USMCA was signed by the Governments of the United States, Mexico, and Canada on November 30, 2018. The USMCA was approved by the U.S. Congress with the enactment on January 29, 2020, of the USMCA Implementation Act, Pub. L. 116-113, 134 Stat. 11, 14 (19 U.S.C. § 4511(a)). General Note (“GN”) 11, HTSUS, implements the USMCA. GN 11(b) sets forth the criteria for determining whether a good is an originating good for purposes of the USMCA.\r\rGN 11(b) states, in relevant part:\r\rFor the purposes of this note, a good imported into the customs territory of the United States from the territory of a USMCA country…is eligible for the preferential tariff treatment provided for in the applicable subheading and quantitative limitations set forth in the tariff schedule as a “good originating in the territory of a USMCA country” only if -\r\ri) the good is a good wholly obtained or produced entirely in the territory of one or more USMCA countries;\r\r(ii) the good is a good produced entirely in the territory of one or more USMCA countries, exclusively from originating materials;\r\r(iii) the good is a good produced entirely in the territory of one or more USMCA countries using non-originating materials, if the good satisfies all applicable requirements set forth in this note (including the provisions of subdivision (o)); ….\r\rHere, the hermetic compressors consist of originating and non-originating materials and are not considered a good wholly obtained or produced entirely in a USMCA country under GN 11(b)(i).\u00A0 Moreover, under GN 11(b)(ii), the hermetic compressors are not a good produced entirely in Mexico exclusively from originating materials.\u00A0 Therefore, we must determine whether the non-originating materials undergo the tariff shift and other requirements provided for in GN 11(b)(iii) and GN 11(o).\u00A0\r\rThe applicable tariff shift rule for merchandise classifiable under subheading 8414.30, HTSUS, is in GN 11(o), HTSUS, which provides, in relevant part:\r\rChapter 84 - 44:\u00A0A change to subheading 8414.30 from any other subheading, except from tariff item 8414.90.30. Since the finished rotors and stators are produced in Mexico, and the remaining foreign materials are classified outside of subheading 8414.30, HTSUS, the requisite tariff shift rule is met. As a result, the three hermetic compressor models are considered originating goods under the USMCA and eligible for preferential treatment upon importation into the United States.\r\rOrigin Marking:\r\rSection 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304), provides that unless excepted, every article of foreign origin imported into the United States shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or its container) will permit, in such a manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the United States, the English name of the country of origin of the article. Congressional intent in enacting 19 U.S.C. 1304 was “that the ultimate purchaser should be able to know by an inspection of the marking on the imported goods the country of which the goods is the product. The evident purpose is to mark the goods so that at the time of purchase the ultimate purchaser may, by knowing where the goods were produced, be able to buy or refuse to buy them, if such marking should influence his will.” See United States v. Friedlander & Co., 27 C.C.P.A. 297, 302 (1940).\r\rSection 134.1(b), CBP Regulations (19 CFR 134.1(b)), defines “country of origin” as the country of manufacture, production, or growth of any article of foreign origin entering the United States. Further work or material added to an article in another country must effect a substantial transformation in order to render such other country the “country of origin” within the meaning of the marking laws and regulations.\r\rPursuant to section 102.0, interim regulations, related to the marking rules, tariff-rate quotas, and other USMCA provisions, published in the Federal Register on July 6, 2021 (86 FR 35566), the rules set forth in sections 102.1 through 102.18 and 102.20 determine the country of origin for marking purposes with respect to goods imported from Canada and Mexico. Section 102.11 provides a required hierarchy for determining the country of origin of a good for marking purposes, with the exception of textile and apparel goods which are subject to the provisions of 19 CFR 102.21. See 19 CFR 102.11.\r\rApplied in sequential order, 19 CFR 102.11(a) provides that the country of origin of a good is the country in which:\r\r(1) The good is wholly obtained or produced;\r\r(2) The good is produced exclusively from domestic materials; or\r\r(3) Each foreign material incorporated in that good undergoes an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Part 102.20 and satisfies any other applicable requirements of that section, and all other applicable requirements of these rules are satisfied.\r\rThe hermetic compressors are neither “wholly obtained or produced” nor “produced exclusively from domestic materials.” Therefore paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) cannot be used to determine country of origin and paragraph (a)(3) must be considered.\r\rAs previously noted, the hermetic compressors are classified in HTSUS subheading 8414.30. The tariff shift requirement that applies to subheading 8414.30 is a change to subheading 8414.10 through 8414.80 from any other subheading, including another subheading within that group. Since all foreign materials incorporated in the hermetic compressors undergo an applicable change in tariff classification as set out in Part 102.20, the tariff shift requirement is satisfied. Accordingly, the country of origin of the three hermetic compressor models for marking purposes is Mexico.\r\rSection 301 Trade Remedies:\r\rWhen determining the country of origin for purposes of applying current trade remedies under Section 301, the substantial transformation analysis is applicable. See, e.g., Headquarters Ruling Letter (“HQ”) H301619, dated November 6, 2018. The test for determining whether a substantial transformation will occur is whether an article emerges from a process with a new name, character, or use different from that possessed by the article prior to processing. See Texas Instruments Inc. v. United States, 681 F.2d 778 (C.C.P.A. 1982). This determination is based on the totality of the evidence. See National Hand Tool Corp. v. United States, 16 C.I.T. 308 (1992), aff’d, 989 F.2d 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1993).\r\rIn headquarters ruling H326072, dated January 25, 2024, CBP considered the country of origin of a reciprocating hermetic compressor sold to home appliance manufacturers for installation in refrigerators and freezers, which is similarly configured to the subject compressors. In part, ruling H326072 held that the country of origin of the hermetic compressors is controlled by where the stator and rotor, the two most essential components of an electric motor, are made. Furthermore, the extent of processing that occurs after the stator and rotor cores are created must also be taken into account. See also NY N309707, dated March 11, 2020; NY N308827, dated January 21, 2020; and NY 316151, dated December 18, 2020.\r\rIn scenario two of H326072, a rotor lamination stack from China underwent extensive additional processing in Thailand such as injection with molten aluminum, creation of the rotor assembly, and assembly with a stator and other parts to create the motor. In combination with the other extensive assembly operations that occurred in Thailand to create the rest of the compressor, the country of origin was determined to be Thailand. In scenario three, the stator laminates from China were combined to create the stator core, bound, then wound with enameled wire in Thailand. The wire was then shaped, insulated, reshaped, and tied. Additionally, the inner surface of the stator was ground, tested, and assembled with the rest of the motor for incorporation into the compressor. Due to the extensive additional processing of the stator combined with the rest of the compressor assembly in Thailand, the country of origin was determined to be Thailand.\r\rHere, both the stator and rotor laminations undergo processing in Mexico to make them suitable electric motor components. Similar to scenario three of H326072, in part, the stator laminations are combined, insulated, and wound with enameled wire before the windings are shaped, tied, crimped, and covered with terminal ends. The inner surface is also rolled to remove burs, and each stator undergoes testing and inspection before further assembly. Like scenario two of H326072, in part, the rotor laminations are cast with aluminum, the inner surface is rolled to shape, and each rotor undergoes testing and inspection before further assembly.\r\rIn summary, based upon your description of the extensive manufacturing operations and sum of the final assembly operations in Mexico, a substantial transformation occurs because the individual components lose their separate identities and become a new article, i.e., hermetic compressors. As such, we find that the country of origin for Section 301 purposes is Mexico. Therefore, the three hermetic compressor models are not subject to additional duties pursuant to Section 301 upon importation into the United States.\r\rThe holding set forth above applies only to the specific factual situation and merchandise description as identified in the ruling request. This position is clearly set forth in Title 19, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 177.9(b)(1). This section states that a ruling letter is issued on the assumption that all of the information furnished in the ruling letter, whether directly, by reference, or by implication, is accurate and complete in every material respect. In the event that the facts are modified in any way, or if the goods do not conform to these facts at time of importation, you should bring this to the attention of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and submit a request for a new ruling in accordance with 19 CFR 177.2. Additionally, we note that the material facts described in the foregoing ruling may be subject to periodic verification by CBP.\r\rThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs and Border Protection Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\rA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

"{""text"":""HQ W967544\r\rJune 24, 2005\r\rCLA-2  RR:CR:GC W967544 RSD\r\rCATEGORY:  Classification\r\rTARIFF NO. 8483.30.80\r\rMr. James F. Morgan\rPBB Global Logistics \r883-D Airport Park Road\rGlen Burnie, Maryland 21061\r\rRE:\tRevocation of NY J88158 regarding the tariff classification of a diesel truck motor support bearing, oil cap with a probe and felt wick lubricator \r\rDear Mr. Morgan:\r\t\rThis is in reference to New York Ruling Letter (NY) NY J88158 dated September 9, 2003, issued by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) National Commodity Specialist Division, (NCSD) regarding the classification, under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), of a diesel motor support bearing, oil cap with a probe and felt wick lubricator used in a truck.  We have reconsidered NY J88158 and determined that the classification of the support bearing, the oil cap and the felt wick lubricator is not correct. \r\rFACTS:\r\rIn NY J88158, CBP stated that the traction motor has three suspension mounts in the truck.  Two are provided by the support bearings that connect to one side of the traction motor to the wheel axle. The third point is provided by two lugs on the motor frame that contact the top and bottom of the nose support assembly on the truck frame. The nose suspension thus arrests the upward or downward movement of the motor depending on the direction of rotation when power is applied.  The support bearings are of the split \""hour glass\"" design. A half of each bearing assembly is inserted in the motor frame while the mating half is installed in the support bearing cap. Both halves are machined together and are identified by a serial number.  The bearings are thus matched and must be kept together and installed in sets.  The commutator end and pinion end bearing assemblies of the current narrow window type are interchangeable. The motor support bearings have a machined brass outer surface, and an inner surface of steel. Each bearing half is 12¼\"" long, having an outside diameter at the flange end of 12\"", and an outside diameter of 9\"" at the opposite end. The thickness of the housing is approximately 9/16\"". One half of the bearing support has a slot to accept the felt wick lubricator. It is 7\"" long by 1 7/8\"" wide.  Together, the two motor support bearing halves weigh approximately 70 pounds.\u000B\rLubrication of traction motor support bearings is provided by a felt wick inserted in the oil reservoir in each bearing cap.  A spring loading arrangement keeps the wicks in firm contact with the wheel axle through an opening in the bearing.  A narrow window traction motor support bearing cap and support bearing arrangement has been in use since the late D-47 traction motor. The narrow window provides increased oil capacity and larger bearing surface as well as an improved wick lubricator.\u000B\rThe Oil Filler Cap is predominately steel with a plastic cap. It has a central metal probe with a spring surrounding the probe. \r\r\tIn J88158, CBP held that the applicable subheading for diesel motor support bearing, oil cap with probe and felt wick lubricator was 8302.30.30, HTSUS, which provides for: “Base metal mountings, fittings and similar articles suitable for furniture, doors, staircases, windows, blinds, coachwork, saddlery, trunks, chests, caskets or the like; base metal hat racks, hat-pegs, brackets and similar fixtures; castors with mountings of base metal; automatic door closers of base metal; and base metal parts thereof: Other mountings, fittings and similar articles suitable for motor vehicles; and parts thereof: Of iron or steel, of aluminum or of zinc.”\r\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhether the motor support bearings, felt wick lubricators and oil filler caps are classified in heading 8302, HTSUS, as other mounting fittings and similar articles suitable for motor vehicles, or in heading 8483, HTSUS, as plain shaft bearings?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\u000B\rClassification under the HTSUS is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then be applied. \r\rThe HTSUS provisions under consideration are as follows:\r\r8302\t\tBase metal mountings, fittings and similar articles suitable\r\t\tfor furniture, doors, staircases, windows, blinds, coachwork, \r\t\tsaddlery, trunks, chests, caskets or the like; base metal hat racks,\r\t\that-pegs, brackets and similar fixtures; castors with mountings of\r\t\tbase metal; automatic door closers of base metal; and base metal\r\t\tparts thereof:\r\r8302.30\tOther mountings, fittings and similar articles suitable for motor vehicles; and parts thereof:\r\r8302.30.60\t\t\tOf iron or steel, aluminum or of zinc…\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\r8483\t\tTransmission shafts (including camshafts and crankshafts) and cranks;\r\t\tbearing housings, housed bearings and plain shaft bearings; gears\rand gearing; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters; flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks; clutches and shaft coupling (including universal joints); parts thereof:\r\r8483.30\t\t\tBearing housings; plain shaft bearings:\t\r\r8483.30.80\t\t\t\tOther…\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\rWhen interpreting and implementing the HTSUS, the Explanatory Notes (ENs) of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System may be utilized.  The ENs, while neither legally binding nor dispositive, provide a guiding \rcommentary on the scope of each heading, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the HTSUS.  CBP believes the ENs should always be consulted. See, T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\u000B\r\tEN 83.02 indicates:\t \r\r   This heading covers general purpose classes of base metal accessory fittings and mountings, such as are used largely on furniture, doors, windows, coachwork, etc.  Goods within such general classes remain in this heading even if they are designed for particular uses (e.g., door handles or hinges for automobiles).  The heading does not, however, extend to goods forming an essential part of the structure of the article, such as window frames or swivel devices for revolving chairs. \r\r  The heading covers:\r…\r\r(C) Mountings, fittings and similar article suitable for motor vehicles  (e.g. motor cars, lorries or motor coaches) not being parts or accessories of Section XVII.  For example: made up ornamental beading strips; <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> rests; grip bars, rails and handles; fittings for blinds (rods, brackets, fastening fittings, spring mechanisms, etc.); interior luggage racks; window opening mechanisms; specialised ash trays; tail-board fastening fittings.\r\r\tBecause neither the HTSUS nor the ENs define the terms mountings and fittings, we have looked at the standard dictionary definitions for these terms to determine whether the diesel motor support bearings are classifiable in heading 8302, HTSUS.  Webster’s New World Dictionary, Second College Edition, 1974 defines the word fitting as:\r\r…2. a small part used to join, adjust, or adapt other parts, as in a system of pipes 3. [pl.] the fixtures, furnishings or decoration of a house, office, automobile, etc.\r\r\tThe web site Dictionary.com defines the word mounting when used as a noun as: \r\r1. The act or manner of mounting.  2. A means of conveyance, such as a horse, on which to ride.  3. An opportunity to ride a horse in a race.  4. An object to which another is affixed or on which another is placed for accessibility, display, or use, especially: \r\ra.\tA glass slide for use with a microscope. \rb.\tA hinge used to fasten stamps in an album. \rc.\tA setting for a jewel. \rd.\tAn undercarriage or stand on which a device rests while \r\t\tin service. \r\rBased on these dictionary definitions for the terms mountings and fittings, we find that the diesel motor support bearings under consideration cannot be characterized as either a fitting or a mounting that would be classified in heading 8302, HTSUS.  Thus, we look at the alternative heading proposed, heading 8483, HTSUS, to determine if it describes the diesel motor support bearing of a truck. \r\r\tEN 84.83 describes bearing housing and plain shaft bearings as:\r\r\t\t(B) BEARING HOUSINGS AND PLAIN SHAFT BEARINGS\r\r  On the other hand plain shaft bearings are classified in this heading even if they are presented without housings.  They consist of rings of anti-friction metal or other material (e.g., sintered metal or plastics).  They may be in one piece or in several pieces clamped together, and form a smooth bearing in which a shaft or axle turned.\r\rThe McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology defines the term anti-friction bearing as “A machine element that permits free motion between moving and fixed parts.  Anti-friction bearings are essential to mechanized equipment: they hold or guide moving machine parts and minimize friction and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.”\r\rThe web site http://www.micropat.com/classdef/CLSDEF/class384/s000000.html \rgives further guidance by explaining that bearings are devices: \r\rdesigned for general use, where one element continuously bears the weight of another, either suspended therefrom, or imposed thereon, and wherein there is either linear motion (e.g., cross head) rotary motion (e.g., of a shaft or axle), or oscillating movement (e.g., a lever) between the two elements.  The bearings may have either sliding, or rolling contact with the supported member.\r\rThe class includes (a) supports for bearings where such supports are specially formed to receive, and are placed in combination with, bearings, and when not limited to any classified art; (b) antifriction means, as balls, or rollers, designed to receive a rotating shaft, or to be used in connection with a pivoted, sliding or rotary element; and (c) lubricating devices wherein any of the above bearing are modified for receiving and supplying lubricant.\r\r\tThe web site http://www.grindwellnorton.co.in/UsefulInfo/ui__bearing.htm indicates:\rBearings are “the Essential items” required to reduce or eliminate the friction between moving parts.  \r\r\t\t*\t*\t*\t\r\r\t\tBearing can be used to provide sliding contact between mating\r\t\tparts or rolling contact between the mating parts.  Hence\r\t\tbroadly the bearing can be classified into two main types:\r\r\t\tPlain Bearings:  Used to minimize “friction” by providing\r\t\tsliding contact between mating parts.\r\rRolling Contact Bearings:  Used to minimize “friction” by providing rolling contact between mating parts.\r\r\r\t\t    Plain Bearings:\r\rPlain bearings operate on the principle of Boundary layer lubrication.  The load carrying capacity of plain bearings depends on the type of film which is formed between the mating surfaces.\r\r\tThe web site Engineering.com explains that:\r\rThe relative motions between the mating surfaces of a plain bearing may take place in the following ways:\r\r1. As pure sliding with any lubricating medium between the moving surfaces.\r2. With hydrodynamic lubrication where a film buildup of lubricating medium is produced.\r3. With hydrostatic lubrication where a lubricating medium is introduced under pressure between the moving surfaces.\r4. With a combination of hydrodynamic and hydrostatic lubrication.\r\r\tBased on the information available, we conclude that the motor support bearings under consideration are split-sleeve bearings used on the traction motor of a  diesel truck.  The diesel motor traction support bearings are sliding bearings that rely on an oil film rather than rolling elements, such as metal balls, to mediate against the friction associated with a rotating shaft that are provided for as plain shaft bearings in heading 8483, HTSUS.\r\r\tIn addition to the motor support bearings, the merchandise under consideration includes two other items, felt wick lubricators and oil filler caps.  It is our understanding that three parts work together as a unit.  The felt wick lubricator supplies the lubrication to the traction motor support bearing, and oil filler cap serves as a storage device for the lubricant that is used by the support bearing.\r\rGRI 3(b) states that [w]hen by application of rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings classification shall be effected as follows:\r\rMixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.\r \t\rThe relevant ENs state that for purposes of Rule 3 the term “goods put up in sets for retail sale” means goods which: (a) consist of at least two different articles which are, prima facie, classifiable in different headings; (b) consist of products or \rarticles put up together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity; and, (c) are put up in a manner suitable for sale directly to users without repacking (e.g., in boxes or cases or on boards).\u000B\rApplying these criteria to the three items, the traction motor support bearings, felt wick lubricators, and oil filler caps, we find that these articles meet each of the three requirements for “sets” stated in the ENs.  As noted above, the bearing is prima facie classifiable in heading 8483, HTSUS, as a plain shaft bearing.  The felt wick lubricator is prima facie classifiable in heading 5602, HTSUS, as felt, while the oil filler cap, which is mostly made of steel, is prima facie classifiable in heading 7326, HTSUS, as other articles of iron or steel.  In providing the lubricant on which the traction motor support bearing slides, the felt wick and oil filler cap work with the traction motor support bearing so that the three items can effectively function together to carry out the specific activity of supporting and reducing friction in the traction motor of a diesel truck.  \r\rWe recognize that the bearing kits are not sold directly to consumers.  However, in HQ 083968 dated July 6, 1989, CBP considered fuel modifications kits that were delivered without repacking to car dealers, who as the ultimate consumers, installed the components of the kits on recalled cars without charge to the owners.  We determined that because the items were put up in a manner suitable for sale directly to users they were sets.  In support of this determination, we pointed out that there is no requirement that sets actually be sold at retail.  In this case, the motor support bearing, felt wick lubricators and oil filler caps are packaged together and sold directly to users who will install the items into the traction motor of a diesel truck without being repackaged.  Thus, we conclude that the three items under consideration constitute a set.  Accordingly, we must then determine which of the three items in the set imparts the essential character to the set.\u000B\rThe ENs indicate that essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods.  It may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight, value, or by the role of the constituent material in relation to the use of the goods.  In the regard to the three items in the set under consideration, the motor support bearing has far greater bulk, weight and value as compared to the other components in the set.  Of the three components in the set, the motor support bearing also plays the principal role of providing the support and reducing friction in the traction motor of a diesel truck.  Therefore, we conclude that the traction motor support bearing is the component that imparts the essential character to the set.  Accordingly, the three items under consideration (the motor support bearings, felt lubricators and the oil filler caps) are classified as a set in the same heading as the motor support bearing, heading 8483, HTSUS, as bearing housings, housed bearings and plain shaft bearings.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tBy application of GRI 3(b), the traction motor support bearings, felt wick lubricators, and oil filler caps used on diesel trucks are classified as a set based on the essential character of the set being transaction motor support bearing in heading 8483, HTSUS.  It is provided for in subheading 8483.30.80, HTSUS, as [t]ransmission shafts (including camshafts and crankshafts) and cranks; bearing housings, housed bearings and plain shaft bearings; gears and gearing; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters; flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks; clutches and shaft coupling (including universal joints); parts thereof: bearing housings; plain shaft bearings: Other…” with a column one, general rate of duty of 4.5 percent ad valorem.  \r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.

Scott\rSenior Consultant, Trade and Regulatory Services\rPBB Global Logistics\r670 Young Street\rTonawanda, New York 14150\r\rRE:  \tRevocation of NY K88338 regarding the classification of motor support bearings, felt wicks and oil filler caps that are used to support traction motors on diesel railroad locomotives\r\rDear Mr. Scott:\r\r\tThis is in response to your letter dated October 21, 2004, on behalf of Miller Felpax Corporation requesting reconsideration of NY K88338 dated August 23, 2004, which concerned the classification of motor support bearings, felt wick lubricators and oil filler caps that are used on diesel railway locomotive cars under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule United States (HTSUS).\r\rFACTS:\r\r\tThe merchandise under consideration consists of three items that are used in diesel railway locomotive vehicles.  The three items are motor support bearings, felt wick lubricators, and oil filler caps.  All three items work together in the traction motor of railway locomotive cars.  The motor support bearings are split bearings used to support the weight of the traction motor on the locomotive drive.  The felt wick lubricator is an oil reservoir with a spring loading device that keeps the felt wick in contact with the wheel axle.  The oil filler cap is predominately made of steel with a plastic outer cap.  It has a central metal probe with a spring surrounding the probe.\r\r\tA traction motor suspension bearing is a split-sleeve bearing, normally 200 mm to 230 mm in diameter and 280 mm long.  The bearing surface is babbit-cast on brass supporting half sleeves.  Typical radial and lateral bearing clearance are 0.3-1.2 mm and 1.6-5 mm, respectively.  Two of these bearings, one each at the commutator and pinion end, support the weight of the traction motor on the locomotive drive axle.  The traction motor support bearings are lubricated by a felt wick assembly, which is typically 25 mm thick by 150 mm wide, with one end held against the axle surface by spring pressure and the opposite end immersed up to 100 mm deep in a 5 liter capacity oil reservoir.  \r\r\tOil is drawn up from the oil reservoir through the wick to the axle surface by capillary action.  The traction motor has three suspension mounts on the locomotive.  Two are provided by the support bearings, which connect one side of the traction motor to the wheel axle.  The third point is provided by two lugs on the motor frame that contact the top and bottom of the nose support assembly on the locomotive frame.  \r\r\tThe nose suspension arrests the upward or downward movement of the motor depending on the direction of rotation when power is applied.  The support bearings are of a split “hour glass” design.  A half of each bearing assembly is inserted in the motor frame while the mating half is installed in the support in the support bearing cap.  Both halves are machined together and are identified by a serial number.  The bearings are matched and must be kept and installed together.  The oil filler cap is predominantly made of steel with a plastic outer cap.  It has a central metal probe with the spring surrounding the probe.  There is a U.S. patent on these products.\r\r\tIn NY K88338 dated August 23, 2004, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) determined that the items under consideration were classified in subheading 8302.49.60 HTSUS, as: “Base metal mountings, fittings and similar articles suitable for furniture, doors, staircases, windows, blinds, coachwork, saddlery, trunks, chests, caskets or the like; base metal hat racks, hat-pegs, brackets and similar fixtures; castors with mountings of base metal; automatic door closers of base metal; and base metal parts thereof: Other mountings, fittings and similar articles, and parts thereof: Other mountings: Other: Other: Of iron or steel, of aluminum or of zinc.”\r\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhether the motor support bearings, felt wick lubricators and oil filler caps are classified in heading 8302, HTSUS, as other mounting fittings and similar articles, or in heading 8607, HTSUS, as parts of railway locomotives, or in heading 8483, HTSUS, as plain shaft bearings?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\u000B\rClassification under the HTSUS is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then be applied. \r\rThe HTSUS provisions under consideration are as follows:\r\r8302\t\tBase metal mountings, fittings and similar articles suitable\r\t\tfor furniture, doors, staircases, windows, blinds, coachwork, \r\t\tsaddlery, trunks, chests, caskets or the like; base metal hat racks,\r\t\that-pegs, brackets and similar fixtures; castors with mountings of\r\t\tbase metal; automatic door closers of base metal; and base metal\r\t\tparts thereof:\r\r\t\t\tOther mountings………\r\r8302.49\t\t\tOther:\r\r\t\t\t\t\tOther:\r\r8302.49.60\t\t\t\t\tOf iron or steel, of aluminum or of zinc…\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\r8483\t\tTransmission shafts (including camshafts and crankshafts) and cranks;\r\t\tbearing housings, housed bearings and plain shaft bearings; gears\rand gearing; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters; flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks; clutches and shaft coupling (including universal joints);\r\t\tparts thereof:\r\r8483.30\t\tBearing housings; plain shaft bearings:\t\r\r8483.30.80\t\t\tOther…\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\r8607\t\tParts of railway or tramway locomotives or rolling stock:\r\r\t\t\tOther:\r\r8607.91.00\t\t\tOf locomotives…\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\rWhen interpreting and implementing the HTSUS, the Explanatory Notes (ENs) of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System may be utilized.  The ENs, while neither legally binding nor dispositive, provide a guiding \rcommentary on the scope of each heading, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the HTSUS.  CBP believes the ENs should always be consulted. See, T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\u000B\r\rEN 83.02 provides in pertinent part:\t \r\r   This heading covers general purpose classes of base metal accessory fittings and mountings, such as are used largely on furniture, doors, windows, coachwork, etc.  Goods within such general classes remain in this heading even if they are designed for particular uses (e.g., door handles or hinges for automobiles).  The heading does not, however, extend to goods forming an essential part of the structure of the article, such as window frames or swivel devices for revolving chairs. \r\rThe heading covers:\r…\r\r(C) Mountings, fittings and similar articles suitable for motor vehicles  (e.g. motor cars, lorries or motor coaches) not being parts or accessories of Section XVII.  For example: made up ornamental beading strips; <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> rests; grip bars, rails and handles; fittings for blinds (rods, brackets, fastening fittings, spring mechanisms, etc.); interior luggage racks; window opening mechanisms; specialised ash trays; tail-board fastening fittings.\r.\r\tBecause neither the HTSUS nor the ENs define the terms mountings and fittings, we have looked at standard dictionary definitions for these terms to determine whether the diesel motor support bearings are classifiable in heading 8302, HTSUS.  Webster’s New World Dictionary, Second College Edition, 1974 defines the word fitting as:\r\r…2. a small part used to join, adjust, or adapt other parts, as in a system of pipes  3. [pl.] the fixtures, furnishings, or decoration of a house, office, automobile, etc.\r\r\tThe web site Dictionary.com defines the word mounting when used as a noun as: \r\r1. The act or manner of mounting.  2. A means of conveyance, such as a horse, on which to ride.  3. An opportunity to ride a horse in a race. 4. An object to which another is affixed or on which another is placed for accessibility, display, or use, especially: \r\r\ra.\tA glass slide for use with a microscope. \rb.\tA hinge used to fasten stamps in an album. \rc.\tA setting for a jewel. \rd.\tAn undercarriage or stand on which a device rests while in service.\r\rBased on these definitions for the terms mountings and fittings, we find that the motor support bearings for railroad cars under consideration cannot be characterized as either a fitting or a mounting that would be classified in heading 8302, HTSUS.  Accordingly, we look at the alternative heading of 8483, HTSUS.\r\r\tEN 84.83 describes bearing housings and plain shaft bearings as:\r\r\t(B) BEARING HOUSINGS AND PLAIN SHAFT BEARINGS\r\t…\r\r  On the other hand plain shaft bearings are classified in this heading even if they are presented without housings.  They consist of rings of anti-friction metal or other material (e.g., sintered metal or plastics).  They may be in one piece or in several pieces clamped together, and form a smooth bearing in which a shaft or axle turns.\r\rThe McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology defines the term anti-friction bearing as: “A machine element that permits free motion between moving and fixed parts.  Anti-friction bearings are essential to mechanized equipment: they hold or guide moving machine parts and minimize friction and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.”\r\rThe web site http://www.micropat.com/classdef/CLSDEF/class384/s000000.html \rgives further guidance by explaining that bearings are devices: \r\rdesigned for general use, where one element continuously bears the weight of another, either suspended therefrom, or imposed thereon, and wherein there is either linear motion (e.g., cross head) rotary motion (e.g., of a shaft or axle), or oscillating movement (e.g. a lever) between the two elements.  The bearings may have either sliding, or rolling contact with the supported member.\r\r\tThe class includes (a) supports for bearings where such supports are \rspecially formed to receive, and are placed in combination with, bearings, and when not limited to any classified art; (b) antifriction means, as balls, or rollers, designed to receive a rotating shaft, or to be used in connection with a pivoted, sliding, or rotary element; and (c) lubricating devices wherein any of the above bearings are modified for receiving and supplying lubricant.\r\r\tThe web site http://www.grindwellnorton.co.in/UsefulInfo/ui__bearing.htm indicates:\r\t\tBearings are “the Essential items” required to reduce or eliminate\r\t\tthe friction between moving parts.  \r\r\t\t*\t*\t*\r\t\r\tBearings can be used to provide sliding contact between mating\r\t\tparts or rolling contact between the mating parts.  Hence\r\t\tbroadly the bearing can be classified into two main types:\r\r\t\tPlain Bearings:  Used to minimize “friction” by providing\r\t\tsliding contact between mating parts.\r\r\t\tRolling Contact Bearings:  Used to minimize “friction” by providing\r\t\trolling contact between mating parts.\r\r\t\t    Plain Bearings:\r\r\t\tPlain bearings operate on the principle of Boundary layer lubrication.\r\t\tThe load carrying capacity of plain bearings depends on the type of \r\t\tfilm which is formed between the mating surfaces.\r\r\tThe web site Engineering.com explains that:\r\r\t\tThe relative motions between the mating surfaces of a plain bearing\r\t\tmay take place in the following ways:\r\r1. As pure sliding with any lubricating medium between the moving surfaces.\r2. With hydrodynamic lubrication where a film buildup of lubricating medium is produced.\r3. With hydrostatic lubrication where a lubricating medium is introduced under pressure between the moving surfaces.\r4. With a combination of hydrodynamic and hydrostatic lubrication.\r\r\tBased on the information available, we conclude that the motor support bearings under consideration are split-sleeve bearings used on the commutator and pinion end of a traction motor of a railway locomotive.  The traction motor bearings are sliding bearings that rely on an oil film rather than rolling elements, such as metal balls, to mediate against the friction associated with a rotating shaft.  Sliding type bearings are provided for as plain shaft bearings in heading 8483, HTSUS.  \r\r\tWe note that although the motor support bearings are used in railroad locomotive cars, they are excluded from being classified in heading 8607, HTSUS, as parts of railroad cars under Note 2(e) to Section XVII which states that: “The expressions ‘parts’ and ‘parts and accessories’ do not apply to the following articles, whether or not they are identifiable as for the goods of this section:\r\r(e) \tMachines or apparatus of heading 8401 to 8479 or parts thereof; articles of heading 8481 or 8482 or, provided they constitute integral parts of engines or motors, articles of heading 8483;\r\r\tThe motor support bearings are necessary for the traction motor to perform its function in the railway locomotives, and they are classifiable in heading 8483, HTSUS, as plain shaft bearings.  Thus, we conclude that they are integral parts of the traction motors, and under Note 2(e), to Section XVII, they are excluded from being classified in heading 8607, HTSUS.\r\r\tIn addition to the motor support bearings, the merchandise under consideration includes two other items, felt wick lubricators and oil filler caps.  It is our understanding that the three parts work together in coordinated manner.  The felt wick lubricator supplies the lubrication of the traction motor support bearing, and oil filler cap serves as the storage device of the lubricant that the traction motor support bearing slides upon.\r\r\tGRI 3 states that: “[w]hen by application of rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings classification shall be effected as follows”:\r\t…\r\r(b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.\r \t\rThe relevant part of the ENs states that for purposes of Rule 3 the term “goods put up in sets for retail sale” means goods which: (a) consist of at least two different articles which are, prima facie, classifiable in different headings; (b) consist of products or articles put up together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity; and, (c) are put up in a manner suitable for sale directly to users without repacking (e.g., in boxes or cases or on boards).\u000B\rApplying these criteria to the three items, the traction motor support bearings, felt wick lubricators, and oil filler caps, we find that these articles meet each of the three requirements for “sets” stated in the ENs.  As noted above, the bearing is prima facie classifiable in heading 8483, HTSUS, as a plain shaft bearing.  The felt wick lubricator is prima facie classifiable in heading 5602, HTSUS, as felt, and the oil filler cap, which is mostly made of steel, is prima facie classifiable in heading 7326, HTSUS, as other articles of iron or steel.  In providing the lubricant on which the traction motor support bearing slides, the felt wick and oil filler cap work with the traction motor support bearing so that the three items can effectively function together to carry out the specific activity of supporting and reducing friction in the traction motor of a railroad locomotive.  \r\rWe recognize that the bearing kits are not sold directly to consumers,.  However, in HQ 083968 dated July 6, 1989, CBP considered fuel modifications kits delivered without repacking to car dealers, who as the ultimate consumers, installed the components of the kits on recalled cars without charge to the owners.  We noted that because the items were put up in a manner suitable for sale directly to users they were sets.  We pointed out that there is no requirement that sets actually be sold at retail.  In this case, the motor support bearing, felt wick lubricators and oil filler caps are packaged together and are sold directly to users who will install these items into the traction motor of a railroad locomotive without being repackaged.  Thus, we conclude that the three items under consideration constitute a set.  Accordingly, we must then determine which of the three items imparts the essential character to the set.\u000B\r\tThe ENs indicate that essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods.  It may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of the constituent material in relation to the use of the goods.  In regard to the three items in the set, the bearing has a far greater bulk, weight and value than the two other components.  The bearings also play the principal role in reducing friction and supporting the traction motor of a railroad locomotive.  Therefore, of the three components, we conclude that the motor support bearing imparts the essential character to the set.  As such, the three items (the motor support bearings, the felt lubricators and the oil filler caps) are classified as a set in the same heading as the motor support bearing, heading 8483, HTSUS, as bearing housings, housed bearings and plain shaft bearings.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tBy application of GRI 3(b), the traction motor support bearings for railroad locomotives, felt wick lubricators, and oil filler caps are classified as a set based on the essential character of the set being the bearing in heading 8483, HTSUS.  It is provided for in subheading 8483.30.80, HTSUS, as “[t]ransmission shafts (including camshafts and crankshafts) and cranks; bearing housings, housed bearings and plain shaft bearings; gears and gearing; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters; flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks; clutches and shaft coupling (including universal joints); parts thereof: Bearing housings; plain shaft bearings: Other…” with a column one, general rate of duty of 4.5 percent ad valorem. \r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.

"{""text"":""\r\rHQ H237738\r\rAugust 17, 2016\r\rCLA-2 OT:RR:CTF:TCM H237738 LWF\r\rCATEGORY: Classification\r\rTARIFF NO.: 6115.10.05\r\rMr. John Peterson\rNeville Peterson LLP\r17 State Street, 19th Floor\rNew York, NY 10004\r\rRE:\tRevocation of New York Ruling (NY) N235286, dated December 7, 2012; tariff classification of graduated compression hosiery\r\rDear Mr. Peterson:\r\r\tThis letter is to inform you that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has reconsidered New York Ruling Letter (NY) N235286, issued to Total Vein Systems, Inc. (“Total Vein”) on December 7, 2012, concerning the tariff classification of under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) of certain graduated compression hosiery.  In ruling letter NY N235286, CBP classified two styles of Total Vein graduated compression hosiery under subheading 6115.30.90, HTSUS, which provides for “Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins) and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Other women’s full-length or knee-length hosiery, measuring per single yarn less than 67 decitex: Other.”  In response to Total Vein’s request, dated January 8, 2013, that CBP reconsider ruling letter NY N235286, CBP has reviewed the ruling letter and determined it to be in error.  Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below, CBP is revoking ruling letter NY N235286.   \r\rPursuant to section 625(c)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. §1625(c)(1)), as amended by section 623 of Title VI, notice of the proposed action was published in the Customs Bulletin, Vol. 50, No. 18, on May 4, 2016. No comments were received in response to the notice.\r\rFACTS:\r\r\tThe Total Vein graduated compression hosiery consists of two styles of stockings, the thigh-length “Surgeon’s Choice” stocking and the calf-length “Boost” stocking.  Both styles of hosiery provide graduated compression in the range of 20-30 or 30-40 mm of mercury (mm HG), with the strongest compression being applied to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and ankle area, and gradually decreasing as the stocking rises up the leg.  The graduated compression is designed to help push blood out of the legs and feet by compressing surface veins to increase arterial pressure, thereby causing more blood to return back towards the heart.\r\r\tThe Total Vein graduated compression hosiery is prescribed by physicians to prevent or treat venous disorders of the legs and feet, including blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), varicose veins, and lymphedema.  The hosiery is sold on the Internet and in medical and surgical supply stores, where trained personnel use detailed measurements of a patient’s leg to properly fit the stockings and socks.  The hosiery is not sold in ordinary retail or fashion retail outlets.  \r\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhether the Total Vein “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost”-style graduated compression hosieries are classified under subheading 6115.10, HTSUS, as graduated compression hosiery, or under subheading 6115.30, HTSUS, as other women’s full-length or knee-length hosiery, measuring per single yarn less than 67 decitex.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tMerchandise imported into the United States is classified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.  Classification under the HTSUS is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then be applied.\r\rHeading 6115, HTSUS, provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\r \r6115\tPanty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins) and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted:\r\r6115.10\tGraduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins):\r\r6115.10.05\tSurgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment\r\r\tOther graduated compression panty hose and tights:\r\r6115.10.10\t\tOf synthetic fibers (659)\r\r[…]\r\r\t\t\tOther graduated compression hosiery\r\r[…]\r\r6115.10.40\t\t\tOf synthetic fibers (632)\r\r[…]\r\r6115.30\tOther women’s full-length or knee-length hosiery, measuring per single yarn less than 67 decitex:\r\r[…]\r\r6115.30.90\tOther\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While not legally binding, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are thus useful in ascertaining the proper classification of merchandise.  It is CBP’s practice to follow, whenever possible, the terms of the ENs when interpreting the HTSUS. See T.D. 89-90, 54 Fed Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rEN 61.15, HS, provides, in pertinent part, that:\r\rThis heading covers the following knitted or crocheted goods, without distinction between those for women or girls and those for men or boys:\r\r(1)   Panty hose and tights designed to cover the feet and legs (hose) and the lower part of the body up to the waist (panty), including those without feet.\r\r(2)   Stockings and socks (including ankle-socks).\r\r(3)   Under stockings, used mainly as a protection against the cold.\r\r(4)   Graduated compression hosiery, e.g., stockings for varicose veins.\r\r(5)   Sockettes intended to protect the feet or toes of stockings from friction or <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.\r\r(6)   Footwear without an outer sole glued, sewn or otherwise affixed or applied to the upper, other than babies’ bootees.\r\r[…]\r\rSubheading Explanatory Note.\r\u00A0\rSubheading 6115.10\r\u00A0\rFor the purposes of subheading 6115.10, “graduated compression hosiery” means hosiery in which the compression is greatest at the ankle and reduces gradually along its length up the leg, so that blood flow is encouraged.\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\r\tAs an initial matter, this office notes that Total Vein’s request for reconsideration of ruling letter NY N235286 concerns the tariff classification of certain graduated compression hosiery under the subheadings of heading 6115, HTSUS.  Accordingly, there is no dispute that the instant merchandise is fully described by the terms of heading 6115, HTSUS, which provides, in pertinent part, for “Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins).”  Therefore, because this matter requires a determination as to the proper classification of merchandise among the subheadings of the same heading, GRI 6 applies.\u0002\r\r\tSpecifically, Total Vein asserts that in ruling letter NY N235286, CBP erroneously classified the “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost”-style graduated compression hosieries under subheading 6115.30.90, HTSUS, as women’s full-length or knee-length hosiery.  Total Vein therefor seeks revocation of NY N235286 and advocates for the classification of its merchandise under subheading 6115.10, HTSUS, as “graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins).”\r\rIn this case, a good indication of the meaning of “graduated compression hosiery” can be obtained from the Explanatory Notes to heading 61.15, HS.  The ENs to subheading 6115.10, HS, describe “graduated compression hosiery” as articles of hosiery in which the compression is greatest at the ankle and reduces gradually along its length up the leg, so that blood flow is encouraged. Subheading EN 6115.10, HS.  Additionally, the U.S. National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) describes “compression stockings” as physician-prescribed hosiery used to treat leg aches and swelling and, to a lesser extent, blood clots after surgery or injury. See Compression Stockings, U.S. National Library of Medicine (May 12, 2015), http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000597.htm. \r\r\tIn accord with the meaning of “graduated compression hosiery” provided by the ENs to heading 61.15, HS, CBP observes that the Total Vein “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost”-style graduated compression hosieries are provided for \u001Feo nomine by the text of subheading 6115.10, HTSUS, as “Graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins).”  Specifically, the Total Vein merchandise consists of two styles of physician-prescribed hosiery that provide graduated compression (at levels of 30-40 or 20-30 mm Hg) to treat venous disorders in the legs and feet, including blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), varicose veins, and lymphedema.  \r\rIn classifying the Total Vein graduated compression hosiery under subheading 6115.10, HTSUS, this office notes that CBP has previously examined similar classification matters, and has found that compression strength and the use of physician prescriptions are important considerations in determining whether an article of graduated compression hosiery can be properly described as a “surgical stocking with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment” of subheadings 6115.10.05. See, e.g., Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 959399, dated December 16, 1996; and HQ 963517, dated January 2, 2002.  In ruling letter HQ 963517, for example, CBP determined that certain graduated compression pantyhose and stocking were properly described as “surgical” hosiery heading 6115, HTSUS, because the articles were primarily prescribed by a physician, and were specially fitted to the patient by certified healthcare personnel.\u0002\r\rBy contrast, CBP has consistently held that non-prescription graduated compression hosiery—identified by comparatively low compression strengths and suitable for purchase without specialty fitting—are not classifiable as “surgical” hosiery.  For example, in HQ 959399, dated December 16, 1996, CBP rejected the classification of various styles of graduated compression panty hose and stockings as “surgical compression stockings for orthopedic purposes, other than stockings merely for the treatment of varicose veins,” because the merchandise supplied less than 30 mm Hg of compression, was available for purchase without prescription or specialty fitting, and was more “fashionable” than articles properly classified as surgical compression stockings. See HQ 959399, dated December 16, 1996.\r\rSimilarly, in HQ 963517, discussed supra, CBP drew a clear distinction between physician-prescribed, “surgical” hosiery with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment, as compared to non-prescription, anti-embolism stockings designed to equalize blood pressure along the leg of a non-ambulatory patient.   There, CBP declined to identify the anti-embolism stockings as “surgical stockings with graduated compression” for the threshold reason that the anti-embolism stockings did not feature graduated compression; however, CBP notably observed that the anti-embolism stockings were nonetheless distinguishable from surgical stockings, because the anti-embolism stockings were available for purchase without a physician prescription and provided significantly less compression as compared to surgical pantyhose and stockings.\u0002 See HQ 963517, dated January 2, 2002.\r\rConsistent with the analysis set forth in prior CBP ruling letters distinguishing “surgical stockings” of subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS, from “other graduated compression panty hose and tights,” CBP finds that the Total Vein “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost”-style graduated compression hosieries are substantially similar to merchandise previously classified by CBP as “surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.”  Specifically, the “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost” hosieries are prescribed by physicians to prevent or treat venous disorders of the legs and feet, including blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), varicose veins, and lymphedema.  The hosieries provide graduated compression in the range of 20-30 or 30-40 mm of mercury (mm HG), and are designed to help push blood out of the legs and feet by compressing surface veins to increase arterial pressure.  Moreover, CBP observes that the “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost” hosieries are sold in medical and surgical supply stores, where trained personnel use detailed measurements of a patient’s leg to properly fit the stockings and socks.  \r\rUpon consideration of the channels of sale, use, and therapeutic effectiveness of the “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost”-style graduated compression hosieries, CBP finds that the hosieries share the commercial identity of “surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment” and are substantially similar to other “surgical” graduated compression stockings previously classified by CBP. See, e.g., ruling letter HQ 963517.  Consequently, the Total Vein graduated compression hosiery is properly classified as graduated compression hosiery of subheading 6115.10, HTSUS, and specifically, in subheading 6115.10.05, which provides, in relevant part, for “surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.”\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tBy application of GRIs 6 and 1, the “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost”-style graduated compression hosieries are classified under heading 6115, HTSUS, specifically subheading 6115.10.05, which provides for “Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins) and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins): Surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.”  The 2016 column one, general rate of duty is free.\r\rEFFECT ON OTHER RULINGS:\r\r\tIn accordance with the analysis set forth above, ruling letter NY N235286, dated December 7, 2012, is hereby REVOKED.\r\rIn accordance with 19 U.S.C. §1625(c), this ruling will become effective 60 days after publication in the Customs Bulletin.  \r\r\r\t\t\t\t\tSincerely,\r\r\r\r\t\t\t\t\tMyles B.

"{""text"":""\rHQ 963534\r\rAugust 29, 2001\r\rCLA-2 RR:CR:TE 963534 BAS\r\rCATEGORY: Classification\r\rTARIFF NO.:  4016.10.0000; 6307.90.9989\r\rLoretta Sanchez\rPort Director\rLos Angeles International Airport\r11099 South Cianega Blvd.\rLos Angeles, California 90045\r\rRE: Decision on Application for Further Review of Protest No. 2704-99-102323\r\rDear Ms. Sanchez: \r\rThis is in reply to the application for further review of Protest No.  2704-99-102323, dated August 26, 1999, on behalf of Pro Line Pacific.  You submitted a sample of the Knee Brace, Patella Stabilizer, Wrist Brace, Wrist Sleeve, Elbow Support and Elbow Sleeve to aid us in our determination. \r\rFACTS: \r\r\tThe merchandise under consideration includes six articles used for the support or protection of different parts of the body: two types of knee braces, two types of wrist braces and two elbow supports.  \r\r\tThe Knee Brace, Patella Stabilizer, Wrist Brace, Wrist Sleeve, Elbow Support and Elbow Sleeve were entered as “other gym/sports equipment; parts and accessories” under Heading 9506.99.6080.  The entry liquidated based upon a Notice of Action issued which changed the classification to “other made up textile articles” as provided for by Heading 6307.90.9989.   The protestant contends that the items are properly classifiable under Heading 9506, HTSUSA.    \r\r\tThe first item, designated as Wrist Sleeve, item number B400, is an appliance made from a fabric constructed by laminating knit fabric on both sides of cellular rubber.  This fabric is then cut to shape and strips with hook-and-loop type fasteners sewn to the outside of the article.  These strips act as a mechanism for adjusting the fit of the sleeve after it is wrapped around the wrist.  This item measures approximately 7.25 inches long by 4 inches wide.  It is designed to support the wrist joint and prevent injury during vigorous physical activity such as participating in various sports.  It depends on the elasticity of the laminated fabric with the rubber core to support the wrist joint, although it does have non-elastic adjusting straps to tighten the wrist sleeve for additional support. \r\r\tThe Elbow Sleeve, designated as item B14, is a tubular product measuring approximately 10 inches long by 3 inches in diameter.  It is constructed from a knit fabric laminated to a layer of cellular rubber.  The sleeve has been formed by hemming opposite edges of a rectangular section of the laminated product, forming the tubular sleeve.  The fabric covered side forms the interior of the tube and functions to facilitate pulling the sleeve onto the elbow joint during physical activity such as in participating in sports and depends entirely on its elasticity to support the elbow joint. \r\rThe Wrist Brace with Splint, designated as item B306, is a wrist brace constructed with knit fabric containing elastometric yarns to increase its elasticity.  It features a woven elasticized strap with hook-and-loop closures to facilitate its attachment to the wrist.  Four flat steel support strips have been sewn into pockets created on the outer surface of the brace.  These steel supports are constructed of wire that has been spirally wound and welded into a flexible strip approximately 3 inches long by .25 inches wide. The wrist brace provides support to the wrist from both the elasticity provided by the fabric and the flexible steel wire strips sewn into the brace.  It should be noted that since the brace will be used by people participating in sports, it does not fully immobilize the wrist and the steel supports are designed for flexibility.\r\rThe Tennis Elbow Support, designated as item B820, is a support appliance consisting of a strip of laminated fabric sewn to a strip of pile fabric.  The laminated fabric consists of a dyed knit fabric laminated to a cellular rubber layer.  This product is cut into a strip and then sewn to a narrow woven pile fabric.  This loop pile fabric forms the loop portion of a hook-and loop fastening system where the hooks are provided by a rectangular applique that is sewn to one end of the elbow support.  This article features a rectangular plastic fitting which functions in conjunction with the hook-and-loop closure to provide a mechanism to fasten the elbow support to the elbow.  This item is used to support the elbow joint and measures approximately 16.5  inches by 2 inches.  In general, whatever elasticity was in the laminated fabric part of this article has been negated by sewing it to the woven pile fabric, so the support is the result of the compression created by tightening the strap and holding it in place with the hook–and-loop closure. \r\r\tThe Knee Brace, designated as item B434, is a knee support constructed by sewing together two panels of a laminated material.  This laminated material consists of a layer of knit fabric fused to a cellular rubber sheet. The brace features four woven adjustable straps with elastomeric yarns in the warp direction.  These straps criss cross and fasten to hook-and-loop closures so the appliance can be wrapped around the knee and fastened in place.  The brace features four steel supports that have been sewn into pockets along both sides of the brace. The steel support strips are similar to those in item B306, above, but are larger. The brace is designed to support the knee joint and prevent injury during vigorous physical activity. \r\r\tThe Patella Stabilizer, designated as item B2313, is a knee support constructed by sewing a panel of laminated fabric into a tubular shape.  The laminated material consists of two layers of knit fabric with a central core of cellular rubber.  This brace, which is specially designed to stabilize the kneecap, has a cellular rubber donut inserted in the brace which frames the patella when the brace is slipped on.  This appliance features two adjustable straps with hook-and-loop fasteners, which facilitate the tightening of the brace.  In addition, this item has four of the same style supports as above inserted into pockets sewn on either side of the patella donut.   \r\r\tAll six braces bear the distributor’s name, Mueller, and trademark, a <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> with a brace on it. \r\rISSUE:\r\rWhether the braces/supports are classifiable under Heading 9021, HTSUSA, as orthopedic appliances, Heading 9506, HTSUSA, as other sports equipment, Heading 4015, as apparel and clothing accessories of vulcanized rubber, Heading 4016, as other articles of vulcanized rubber, Heading 6212, HTSUSA as body supporting garments or under Heading 6307 HTSUSA, as other made-up textile articles? \r    \r   LAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the Headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the Headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then be applied. \r\rThe Knee Brace, Patella Stabilizer, Wrist Brace, Wrist Sleeve, Elbow Support and Elbow Sleeve are potentially classifiable in six HTSUSA headings.  One possible heading is Heading 9021, HTSUSA, which provides for orthopedic appliances and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability.  Other possible Headings for the merchandise include Heading 6212, HTSUSA, which provides for braces, Heading 9506, HTSUSA, which provides for articles and equipment for general physical exercise and other sports, Heading 4015, HTSUSA, which provides for articles of apparel and clothing accessories of vulcanized rubber, Heading 4016, HTSUSA, which provides for other articles of vulcanized rubber other than hard rubber and Heading 6307, HTSUSA, which provides for other made up textile articles.\r\rHEADING 9021, HTSUSA \r\r\tHeading 9021, HTSUSA, provides for “Orthopedic appliances, including crutches, surgical belts and trusses; splints and other fracture appliances; artificial parts of the body; hearing aids and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability; parts and accessories thereof.” \r\rWhen interpreting and implementing the HTSUS, the Explanatory Notes (ENs) of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System may be utilized.  The ENs, while neither legally binding nor dispositive, provide a guiding commentary on the scope of each Heading, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the HTSUS. Customs believes the ENs should always be consulted.  See T.D. 89-90, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rThe ENs to Heading 9021 state that:\r\rThis Heading does not include supporting belts or other support articles of the kind referred to in Note 1 (b) to this Chapter,…(generally Heading 62.12 or 63.07).\r\rNote 1 (b) of Chapter 90 maintains:\r\rThis chapter does not cover supporting belts or other support articles of textile material, whose intended effect on the organ to be supported or held derives solely from their elasticity (for example, maternity belts, thoracic support bandages, abdominal support bandages, supports for joints or muscles (Section XI).   \r\rThe Wrist Sleeve, Wrist Brace and Elbow Sleeve at issue depend on elasticity to support the joints and therefore, would be excluded from classification in heading 9021 on the basis of Note 1 (b) of Chapter 90.  Having determined that the Wrist Sleeve, Wrist Brace and Elbow Sleeve would be excluded from classification in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, we must determine whether the Elbow Support, Patella Stabilizer and Knee Brace are properly classifiable in Heading 9021.\r\r\tAccording to Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, Edition 15, 1985, orthopedic is defined as “concerning orthopedics; prevention or correction of deformities.”  A deformity is defined by Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary as “an alteration in the natural form of a part or organ.  Distortion of any part or general disfigurement of the body.  It may be acquired or congenital.  If present after injury, usually implies the presence of fracture, dislocation or both.  May be due to extensive swelling, extravasation of blood or rupture of muscles.”  \r\rThe importer states that the subject merchandise is utilized for the enhancement of an athlete’s performance and protection from injury during sport activities.  The importer does not describe the subject merchandise as being utilized to “prevent or correct bodily deformities.”  There is no mention of use of the brace at issue in relation to the presence of fractures or dislocation.  \r\rIn addition, Mueller does not focus on the healthcare market but rather the sports medicine/sports equipment market.  Advertising on Mueller’s website suggests that “Mueller remains on the cutting edge of technology and continues to offer new and innovative products, both for the serious athlete and team as well as the weekend warrior.”  [Emphasis added]  Products marketed to serious athletes and “weekend warriors” to enhance performance are significantly distinguishable from items intended to be worn in order to function while recovering from a fracture or dislocation.  Accordingly, we believe the subject merchandise is not included in Heading 9021.  \r\rThe ENs to Heading 9021 state that the orthopedic appliances referred to in the heading are appliances for  “preventing or correcting bodily deformities” or “supporting or holding organs following an illness or operation.” The EN to Heading 9021 lists the type of orthopedic appliances that are included in that Heading as follows: \r\r1.  Appliances for hip diseases (coxalgia, etc.)\rHumerus splints (to enable use of an arm after resection), (extension splints).\r Appliances for the jaw. \r Traction, etc., appliances for the fingers.\r Appliances for treating Pott’s disease (straightening head and spine)\rOrthopaedic footwear, having enlarged leather stiffener, which may be reinforced with a metal or cork frame, made only to measure. \rSpecial insoles, made to measure.\rDental appliances for correcting deformities of the teeth (braces, rings, etc.) \rOrthopedic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> appliances (talipes appliances, leg braces, with or without spring support for the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, surgical boots, etc.).\r Trusses (inuinal, cural, umbilical, etc., trusses) and rupture appliances. \r Appliances for correcting scoliosis and curvature of the spine as well as all medical or surgical corsets and belts (including certain supporting belts) characterized by: \r\rSpecial pads, springs, etc., adjustable to fit the patient.\rThe materials of which they are made (leather, metal , plastic, etc.); or\rThe presence of reinforced parts, rigid pieces of fabric or bands of various widths. \r\rThe special design of these articles for a particular orthopedic purpose distinguishes them from ordinary corsets and belts, whether or not the latter also serve to support or hold.\r\r12.  Orthopedic suspenders (other than simple suspenders of knitted, netted or crocheted materials, etc.)   \r\rExamination of the Knee Brace, Patella Stabilizer, and Elbow Support reveals that the items are not “ejusdem generis” or “of the same kind” of merchandise as orthopedic appliances listed in Heading 9021.  The merchandise at issue is not intended to be worn post-operation or to correct a bodily deformity but rather to be used to enhance performance during exercise or sports activities.  The Elbow Support is designed to relieve and prevent tennis elbow pain and is marketed as being excellent for golfers, bowlers.  The Knee Brace and Patella Stabilizer are claimed to prevent common knee injuries and to protect unstable knees.  The patella opening helps stabilize the knee cap.  The metal steel springs in both knee braces are quite flexible and therefore serve to differentiate them from the exemplars listed in the ENs to Heading 9021, HTSUSA. The ENs state that the splints and other fracture appliances referenced in Heading 9021 may be used either to immobilize injured parts of the body or to set fractures.  While the knee braces at issue do restrict movement, they do not immobilize the knee as contemplated in the EN to Heading 9021. [Emphasis added] See HQ 964317, dated May 1, 2001 (ruling that a knee brace made of 90 percent neoprene and 10 percent nylon or polyester and elastic with two hinged metal braces would be excluded from classification in Heading 9021 because it does not immobilize the knee); HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995, (ruling that a neoprene wrist support containing permanently inserted, rigid plastic support bars that were designed to immobilize the wrist in order to relieve tendinitis and prevent recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome were properly classifiable in 9021).  (Emphasis added) \r\rThese items which may be used to prevent sprains or strains and to support the area of the body where they are worn are not considered to be of the class or kind of appliance used with recovery from bodily deformity or used following illnesses or operations of an incapacitating nature.  See NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991 (hinged knee support and back support with plastic stiffeners excluded from Heading 9021).  The appliances included, in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, e.g., appliances for hip disease, for correcting scoliosis and trusses (used generally for treating hernias) are similar in the sense that they enable the wearer to engage in the activities of everyday life.  The Knee Brace, Patella Stabilizer, and Elbow Support are not items that are generally worn in order to function in everyday life but rather to engage in sports activities.  We note that orthopaedic footwear and special insoles might also be used by the wearer to engage in athletic activities but the EN provides that those items are made to measure and not marketed to a mass market as are the subject merchandise in the instant case. The fact that most, if not all, of the items referred to in the EN to Heading 9021 must be fitted to a particular individual is also a feature which the items at issue do not share with the enumerated articles. \r\rAlthough the Knee Brace, Patella Stabilizer, and Elbow Support would not be excluded from Heading 9021 because they do not derive support solely from their elasticity, as discussed above, the items are nonetheless not esjudem generis with the exemplars in Heading 9021. \r\r\r\rHEADING 9506\r\rHaving precluded classification in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, we must determine whether classification in Heading 9506, HTSUSA is appropriate. Heading 9506, HTSUSA provides for, inter alia, articles and equipment for gymnastics, athletics, other sports and outdoor games\r\rThe ENs to Heading 9506 state in pertinent part: \r\rThis heading covers: \r\r* * *\r(B) Requisites for other sports and outdoor games (other than toys presented in sets, or separately of Heading 95.03), e.g.:\r\r* *\r(13) Protective equipment for sports or games, e.g., fencing masks and breast plates, elbow and knee pads, cricket pads, shin-guards.  \r\rThe sports protective equipment intended for inclusion within Heading 9506, HTSUSA, recognizes only that equipment designed exclusively for protection against injury, that is equipment having protective features with the sole or primarily function of directly absorbing the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects.  See HQ 958791, dated May 13, 1996 (knee pads used for playing sports, elbow pads and wrist guards are classifiable in Heading 9506);  HQ 958387, dated April 8, 1996 (protective gear including knee and elbow pads used by in-line skaters to protect their knees, elbows and wrists against impact and abrasion are properly classifiable in Heading 9506);  HQ 957120, dated January 31, 1995  (ruling that wrist guards utilized for in line skating are classifiable under Heading 9506);  HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995 (ruling that  a hand/forearm pad, shin guards and elbow pad specifically designed to prevent injury while playing football or soccer are properly classifiable as protective sports equipment under Heading 9506); HQ 951406, dated July 13, 1992 (knee pads, elbow pads and wrist guards consisting of hard plastic cups and high impact plastic splint inserts, utilized for sporting activities have the primary function of protecting the wearer during sporting activities and are therefore properly classifiable in Heading 9506) [Emphasis added]; NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991 (a padded shin guard, specially designed to protect against leg blows in the game of soccer and an elbow support which primarily provides protection against blows or falls qualify for classification in Heading 9506 but a hinged knee support and a back support were excluded from Heading 9506 because neither of these items have as their sole or primary function to directly absorb the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects).  \r\rSignificantly, none of the subject merchandise, here in issue, is described as either a “pad” or a “guard.”  Rather the items are “supports” or “sleeves.” Nor is any of the subject merchandise designed with the sole or primary function of directly absorbing the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects.  The Mueller website describes the Knee Brace at issue as an article “whose unique design helps to prevent common knee injuries, protects unstable knees and allows an adjustable custom fit.”  The Patella Stabilizer is described as “ideal for post injury pain relief and arthritic knee conditions.” The neoprene Elbow Sleeve is described as an item “recommended for elbow injuries, strains and arthritic elbow conditions.”  The Wrist Brace is described as a preventative for carpal tunnel syndrome.  It provides firm comfortable support and helps prevent wrist injury.  The Elbow Support/Strap is advertised as “excellent for golfers, bowlers, tennis players, gardeners, dentists, carpenters and all activities involving starting on forearm muscles.”  The Wrist Sleeve is recommended for “wrist strains, sprains, tendonitis, bursitis and arthritic wrist conditions.”  Accordingly, Heading 9506, HTSUSA does not apply to the subject merchandise, as their primary function is not to protect from impact imposed by blows, collisions or flying objects.\r\rTEXTILE VERSUS RUBBER MATERIAL\r\rHaving eliminated the possibility of classification under Heading 9021, HTSUSA and Heading 9506, HTSUSA, we must now determine whether the subject merchandise is properly classifiable in Chapter 62, HTSUSA or Chapter 63, HTSUSA.  Classification in both Chapters 62 and 63,  HTSUSA require that the goods be composed of textile fabric.  Since the Knee Brace and Elbow Sleeve are composed of cellular rubber backed with knit fabric, we must first determine whether the laminated materials from which these items have been constructed are considered textile fabrics for the purposes of the HTS. \r\rThe following two chapters must be considered in analyzing the proper heading for the material making up the Knee Brace and the Elbow Sleeve:  Chapter 40, providing for “rubber and articles thereof” and Chapter 59, providing for “impregnated, coated, covered or laminated textile fabrics.” \r\rNote 4 to Chapter 59 states, in pertinent part, that the heading “does not, apply to plates, sheets or strip of cellular rubber, combined with textile fabric, where the textile fabric is present merely for reinforcing purposes (Chapter 40).”  In defining the meaning of the terms “merely for reinforcing purposes” the Explanatory Notes state in part in explaining the scope of Heading 4008: \r\rIn this respect, unfigured, unbleached, bleached or uniformly dyed textile fabrics, when applied to one face only of these plates, sheets or strip, are regarded as serving merely for reinforcing purposes.\r\rAccordingly, since the textile material in both the Elbow Sleeve and the Knee Brace are applied to only one side of the material, the textile fabric is present merely for reinforcing purposes, and therefore, they are excluded from classification under Chapter 59.\r\rHaving excluded classification of the Elbow Sleeve and Knee Brace under Chapter 59, we must now determine whether they are properly classified in Chapter 40. \r\rThe General ENs to Chapter 40 (d) state that: \r\rThe classification of rubber and textile combinations is essentially governed by Note1 (ij) to Section XI, Note 3 to Chapter 56 and Note 4 to Chapter 59, and as regards conveyor or transmission belts or belting by Note 8 to Chapter 40 and Note 6 (b) to Chapter 59.  The following products are covered by this chapter: \r\rPlates, sheets and strip of cellular rubber, combined with textile fabrics (as defined in Note 1 to Chapter 59), felt or nonwovens, where textile is present merely for reinforcing purposes. \r\rAs the Elbow Sleeve and Knee Brace are composed of cellular rubber backed with knit fabric, the textile is present merely to reinforce and therefore the items would be covered by Chapter 40.  Having established that the base fabric is considered to be rubber as opposed to textile, we must determine under which heading within Chapter 40, the Knee Brace and the Elbow Sleeve are properly classified.  In Chapter 40, there are two potential headings in which the Knee Brace and the Elbow Sleeve might be classified.  One possible heading is 4015, HTSUSA, which provides for “Articles of apparel and clothing accessories (including gloves), for all purposes, of vulcanized rubber other than hard rubber.”   The other potential heading is 4016, HTUSA which provides for “Other articles of vulcanized rubber other than hard rubber.” The Knee Brace and the Elbow Sleeve are worn to provide support during exercise as opposed to being worn as a clothing accessory or article of apparel.  Accordingly, the Knee Brace and the Elbow Sleeve are properly classifiable in subheading 4016.10.0000, HTSUSA, which provides for “other articles of vulcanized rubber other than hard rubber: of cellular rubber.” \r\r   The remaining goods are made up of textile material and therefore Heading 6212, HTSUSA and Heading 6307, HTSUSA will potentially capture the goods.   Specifically, the Patella Stabilizer, the Wrist Sleeve and the Elbow Support are composed of rubber reinforced on both sides with textile fabric.  The Wrist Brace is composed of textile fabrics incorporating rubber yarns.   See Note 10 to Section XI.\r\rCHAPTERS 62 OR 63\r\rHaving established that all of the items except the Knee Brace and Elbow Sleeve are made from textile fabric but that neither the provision for sporting equipment, Heading 9506, HTSUSA nor the provision for orthopedic appliances, Heading 9021, HTSUSA apply, we must now examine whether they may be classifiable in either chapter 62 as body supporting articles or in chapter 63 as other made up articles.\r\rHEADING 6212\r\rHeading 6212 provides for inter alia, braces. The ENs to Heading 6212, HTSUSA, state in pertinent part:\r\rThe Heading covers articles of a kind designed  for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> as body-supporting garments or as supports for certain other articles of apparel, and parts thereof…\r\rThe Heading includes, inter alia: \r\r(1) Brassieres of all kinds.\r(2) Girdles and panty-girdles.\r(3) Corselettes (combinations of girdles or panty-girdles and brassieres). \r(4) Corsets and corset belts.   These are usually reinforced with flexible metallic, whalebone or plastic stays, and are generally fastened by lacing or by hooks. \r(5) Suspender-belts, hygienic belts, supersensory bandages, suspender jock-straps braces, suspenders, garters, shirt-sleeve supporting arm-bands and armlets.\r(6) Body belts for men (including those combined with under pants)\r(7) Maternity, post-pregnancy or similar supporting corrective belts, not being orthopedic appliances of Heading 90.21.  \r\rThis office is of the opinion that the exemplars to Heading 6212 are united by the fact that they support apparel or other items (e.g. garters) or are forms of garments (e.g. brassieres) and are generally worn underneath other garments as, for example, maternity belts or men’s body belts.  See HQ 952568, dated January 28, 1993; HQ 952390, dated December 16, 1992; HQ 952201, dated October 26, 1992.  The subject merchandise, unlike the exemplars in the ENs to Heading 6212, are not worn as garments or accessories to garments and are therefore not properly classifiable in Heading 6212.  \r \rHEADING 6307\r\rHeading 6307, HTSUSA, is a residual provision which provides for other made up article of textiles. Section Note 7 (e) of Section XI, which covers textiles and textile articles states in pertinent part as follows: \r\r7. For the purposes of this Section the expression “made up” means: \r\rAssembled by sewing…..\r\rThe instant articles have been assembled by sewing, therefore they constitute made up textile articles.  The Explanatory Notes state regarding Heading 6307:\r\rThis Heading covers made up articles of any textile material which are not included more specifically in the Heading of Section XI or elsewhere in the Nomenclature. \r\rSince the Patella Stabilizer, Elbow Support, Wrist Brace and Wrist Sleeve at issue are not covered by any more specific Heading they are classifiable in Heading 6307, HTSUSA.\r\rThe EN to 6307 specifically provide for articles such as the Patella Stabilizer, Wrist Brace/Sleeve and Elbow Supports in Note (27) which notes that Heading 6307 includes, in particular: \r\rSupport articles of the kind referred to in Note 1 (b) to Chapter 90 for joints (e.g., knees, ankles, elbows or wrist) or muscles (e.g., thigh muscles), other than those falling in other Headings of Section XI. \r\t\r Customs has classified merchandise that is almost identical to the Patella Stabilizer at issue, knee braces with hinged support bars, under Heading 6307.   See HQ 964317, dated May 1, 2001; HQ 952568, dated January 28, 1993.  In addition, this ruling is consistent with several other rulings in which articles supporting joints or organs were classified in Heading 6307.  See HQ 958791, dated May 13, 1996 (revoking NY 840648 and classifying a knit elbow/knee support composed of 39 percent cotton and 61 percent man made fibers with ten magnets sewn into the supporter in Heading 6307); HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995 (ruling that adjustable neoprene knee supports which support the joint solely by means of their elasticity should remain classified in Heading 6307); HQ 952295, dated January 5, 1993 (ruling that a heel cup/anklet composed of neoprene and a soft flexible material such as molded rubber or thermoplastic was classifiable in Heading 6307); HQ 951844, dated September 4, 1992 (ruling that a pair of cotton/stretch nylon wristbands neither of which contained a protective insert or pad were classifiable in Heading 6307); HQ 952390, dated December 16, 1992 (ruling that a lumbar support belt with four or six covered metal vertical stays is classifiable in Heading 6307); NY E82026, dated June 16, 1999 (knee sleeve and wrist sleeve composed of neoprene rubber laminated on both sides with knit fabric classified in Heading 6307).\r\rWe note that in NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991, knee supports with hinges, were classified in Heading 6212, HTSUSA.   In HQ 087552, dated  October 1, 1990 and HQ 086667, dated May 9, 1990, a knee stabilizer, and a knee support respectively both composed of neoprene rubber laminated on both the inner and outer surfaces with knit nylon fabric were classified in Heading 6212, HTSUSA.  Also in NY A89561, dated December 11, 1996, ankle braces made of a heavy reinforced textile material for the purpose of providing ankle support for football players were classified in Heading 9021, HTSUSA.  Finally, in NY D88848, dated April 1, 1999,  a knee brace and a knee immobilizer worn only during sporting events by players to provide some support and to reduce the probability of reinjuring the knee joint were classified in Heading 9021, HTSUSA.   Appropriate steps are currently being taken to review these decisions and to modify and revoke those rulings as necessary. \r\rHOLDING: \r\rThe Knee Brace and Elbow Sleeve are properly classified in subheading 4016.10.0000, HTSUSA which provides for “Other articles of vulcanized rubber other than hard rubber: Of cellular rubber.”  The general column one rate of duty is “Free.”  There currently is no textile quota category applicable to this provision.   \r\rThe Patella Stabilizer, Wrist Brace, Wrist Sleeve and Elbow Support are properly classified in subheading 6307.90.9989, HTSUSA  which provides for “Other made up articles, including dress patterns; Other; Other: Other: Other: Other.”  The general column one rate of duty is 7 percent ad valorem.   There currently is no textile quota category applicable to this provision.  \r\rIn accordance with Customs Directive 099 3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject: Revised Protest Directive, section 3 A. (11) (b), you are to mail to the Protestant this decision and Customs Form 19, no later than 60 days from the date of this letter.

You have submitted descriptive literature and samples for two styles of footwear.\r\rExamination of the submitted sample of style #3025051 UA ALFA SLIDE finds a unisex, open-toe/open-heel, below-the-ankle, slide sandal.  The external surface area of the upper consists of polyurethane rubber/plastics material with two polyester textile straps measuring approximately one inch wide.  The strap nearest the toes is stationary while the strap nearest the ankle has a hook and loop closure.  This closure is not necessary to secure the wearers <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The outer sole is made of molded rubber/plastics material.  The shoe has no foxing or foxing like band.  The F.O.B. value is over $12 per pair.\r\rThe applicable subheading for unisex style #3025051 UA ALFA SLIDE will be 6402.99.4960, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics: other footwear: other: other: other: footwear with open toes or open heels; other: other: for women. The rate of duty will be 37.5 percent ad valorem.\r\rStyle #3025042 UA FAT TIRE TRVL is a unisex closed toe/closed heel, below-the-ankle, lace-up shoe. It is said the footwear is used as after-sport recovery <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  The upper consists of predominantly textile materials and a rubber/plastic eye stay with textile loops.  A continuous lace is threaded through the loops and can be tightened to improve the fit but does not secure the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> for athletic activity.  The upper lacks support and does not have a separate tongue on a lower plane.  The outer sole is comprised of inflexible TPU rubber or plastics with spaced, round nubs in contact with the ground.  A removable bungee cord at the back of the heel is secured by hook and loop closures on either side of the heel.  This cord serves as an accessory to give the wearer the option to attach the footwear to a backpack.  Rubber/plastics accounts for more than 10 percent of the total weight of the shoe. There is no foxing or foxing like band and it is not protective.  The F.O.B. value is $12 per pair. \r\rThe applicable subheading for unisex style #3025042 UA FAT TIRE TRVL will be 6404.19.3960, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: footwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except footwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper: other: other: other: for women. The rate of duty will be 37.5 percent ad valorem.\r\rPlease note the submitted samples do not meet the country of origin marking requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1304.  Accordingly, the footwear would be considered not legally marked under the provisions of 19 C.F.R. 134.11 which states, \""every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit, in such manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the U.S. the English name of the country of origin of the article.\"" \r\rThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\rA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

"{""text"":""\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rHQ H008845\r\rOctober 3, 2008\r\rCLA-2 OT:RR:CTF:TCM H008845 GC\r\rCATEGORY:  Classification \r\rTARIFF NO.:  6403.99.90\r\rMr. John Pellegrini, Esq.  \rMcGuire Woods, LLP  \r1345 Avenue of the Americas\rNew York, New York 10105-0106\r\rRE:\tTariff classification of women’s bowling shoes from China\r\rDear Mr. Pellegrini: \r\rThis is in response to your letter dated March 20, 2007, on behalf of your client, H.H. Brown Shoe Company, Inc., in which you request reconsideration of New York Ruling Letter (NY) H89667, dated April 9, 2002.  \r\rWe have since reviewed NY H89667 and find it to be distinguishable from this present case on the basis that the bowling shoes subject to NY H89667 were imported under different condition than the bowling shoes at issue here.  Per a phone conversation with a member of my staff on May 29, 2008, we will treat your reconsideration request as a prospective ruling request on the tariff classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) of the subject merchandise.     \r\rFACTS:\r\r\tThe merchandise at issue, identified as style number B998-1, consists of a pair of women’s bowling shoes, a plastic slip-on shoe cover for one of the shoes, a fabric shoe bag and a smaller “sole and heel” bag containing four interchangeable soles and four interchangeable heels.  \r\r\tThe subject footwear is a pair of woman’s oxford-height bowling shoes with a leather upper and six-eyelet closure.  Because the pair of shoes is designed for use by a right-handed bowler, the right shoe contains a rubber/plastic outer sole while the outer sole of the left shoe (the “sliding shoe”) incorporates interchangeable heels and “slide soles”, which are attached to the bottom of the shoe via a hook and loop system.  You have stated that at the time of importation, a leather “slide sole” and a rubber/plastic heel will be attached to the “sliding shoe”.  You propose that the footwear is properly classifiable under subheading 6403.99.90, HTSUS, which provides for: [f]ootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of leather: [o]ther footwear: [o]ther: [o]ther: [o]ther: [o]ther: [f]or other persons: [v]alued over $2.50/pair…”  \r\r\tThe shoe bag is constructed from lightweight man-made woven fiber and is labeled with Dexter’s trademark on one side.  The open end of the shoe bag is closed with a drawstring.  When laid flat, the shoe bag measures approximately 7.5 inches wide at the open end by 16 inches long.  The bag is tapered at the closed end.  \r\r\tThe “sole and heel” bag is constructed from the same material as the shoe bag, and also like the shoe bag, is closed by a drawstring and bears the Dexter trademark on one side.  On the opposite side of the “sole and heel” bag is a “slide value guide,” which allows the bowler to determine which sole and heel combination will provide the desired amount of sliding capability for the bowling surface.  The “sole and heal” bag is rectangular in shape, measuring approximately 9 inches wide at the open end by 8 inches long.  You propose that both the “sole and heel” bag and the shoe bag are classifiable under subheading 6307.90.98, HTSUS, which provides for: “[o]ther made up articles, including dress patterns: [o]ther: [o]ther: [o]ther…”.    \r\r\tThe bottom of three of the “slide soles” are composed of leather, and one of the “slide sole” bottoms is composed of textile microfiber.  The bottoms of three of the heels are composed of a rubber/plastics material of differing shapes and one of the heel bottoms is composed of leather.  All of the interchangeable pieces are labeled with numbers that correspond with the “slide value guide” located on the “sole and heel” bag.  You propose that the leather “slide soles” are classifiable under subheading 6406.99.60, HTSUS, which provides for, inter alia: “[p]arts of footwear (including uppers whether or not attached to soles other than outer soles); removable insoles, heel cushions and similar articles; gaiters, leggings, and similar articles, and parts thereof: [o]ther: [o]f other materials…”.  You propose that the textile “slide sole” is classifiable under subheading 6406.99.15, HTSUS.  You propose classification in subheading 6406.20.00, HTSUS, for the heels composed of rubber/plastic and subheading 6406.99.60, HTSUS, for the heel with a leather surface.  \r\r\tThe shoe cover is to be worn on the “sliding shoe” when the wearer is not walking on the bowling surface.  It is composed of rubber/plastics material.  The upper of the shoe cover is red, and is covered by the Dexter logo in white.  The outer sole of the shoe cover is gray, with the Dexter trademark written across the bottom in red lettering.  An elastic band runs the perimeter of the opening.  You propose that the shoe cover is classifiable under subheading 3926.90.99, HTSUS, which provides for: “[o]ther articles of plastics and articles of other materials of headings 3901 to 3914: [o]ther: [o]ther…”.  \t \r\r\tAll of the components that make up the subject merchandise will be packaged and sold at retail together.  \r\rISSUE(S):  \r\rWhether the shoes are classified in subheading 6403.99.90, HTSUS,  which provides for: [f]ootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of leather: [o]ther footwear: [o]ther: [o]ther: [o]ther: [o]ther: [f]or other persons: [v]alued over $2.50/pair…”, or subheading 6405.10.00, HTSUS, which provides for: [o]ther footwear: [w]ith uppers of leather or composition leather…”  \r\rWhether the interchangeable “slide soles”, heels, shoe cover, and shoes constitute a composite good or a retail set?  \r\rWhat is the tariff classification under the HTSUS of the subject bags?  \r\t\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification under the HTSUS is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 may then be applied in order.  \r\rAs you have stated, the “sliding shoe” will be imported with a leather “slide sole” already attached.  Because the material of the “slide sole” is the material most in contact with the ground\u0002, the “sliding shoe”, as imported, constitutes a shoe with a leather upper and a leather outer sole, classifiable in subheading 6403.99.90, HTSUS.  The other shoe has a leather upper and a rubber/plastic outer sole, classifiable in subheading 6403.99.60, HTSUS.  \r\r\tBecause each shoe that comprises the subject pair is prima facie classifiable in different subheadings, classification pursuant to GRI 1 is not possible.\r\rGRI 3, which governs the classification of composite goods and sets, states, in pertinent part: \r\rWhen, by application of rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows:\r*\t*\t*\r(b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up\r     of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which\r     cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they\r     consisted of the material or component which gives them their\r     essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.\r\rAs stated in GRI 3(b), goods put up in sets for retail sale will be classified according to the material or component that imparts the set with its essential character.  In its discussion concerning “essential character,” the Harmonized Community Description and Coding System Explanatory Note (EN) to GRI 3(b) states that\u0002: \r\rThe factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods.  It may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of a constituent material in relation to the use of the goods.  \r\r\tSection (IX) of the EN to GRI 3 states the following: \r\rFor the purposes of this Rule, composite goods made up of different components shall be taken to mean not only those in which the components are attached to each other to form a practically inseparable whole but also those with separable components, provided these components are adapted one to the other and are mutually complementary and that together they form a whole which would not normally be offered for sale in separate parts. (Emphasis in original) \r\r\tEach shoe is a component of the subject pair.  While they are not attached to each other to form a practically inseparable whole, they are adapted one to the other and are mutually complementary in a sense that the shoes are each worn on a particular <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The shoes also perform mutually complementary functions, as one is designed to slide while the other is designed to provide traction.  Moreover, it is decidedly unlikely to offer for sale one shoe without the other.  Accordingly, we find that the subject pair of shoes constitutes a composite goods for the purposes of GRI 3.    \r  \rIn comparing the “sliding shoe” with the other shoe, it is impossible to determine which imparts the pair with its essential character by applying GRI 3(b).  As such, GRI 3(c) is applied.\u0002  It states: \r\rWhen goods cannot be classified by reference to 3(a) or 3(b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.  \r\rConsequently, the pair of bowling shoes are classified in subheading 6403.99.90, HTSUS, which provides for shoes having uppers and outer soles of leather.  \r\rThe pair of bowling shoes and the shoe bag also constitute a composite good within the meaning of GRI 3.  Although the subject bowling shoes and shoe bag are not attached to one another, the items are mutually complementary and form a whole that would not normally be offered for sale in separate parts.  Furthermore, the shoes impart the essential character.  See New York Ruling Letter (NY) H89734, dated April 15, 2002; NY B88960, dated September 9, 1997.  Accordingly, the bowling shoes and shoe bag are classifiable under subheading 6403.99.90, HTSUS. \r\rYou argue that the subject shoe cover, the detachable heels and soles are not components of either a composite good or a set when packaged with the bowling shoes, and should thus be classified separately.  A review of various websites indicates that the heels, soles and shoe cover are sold separately.\u0002  As such, we agree that the merchandise is not a composite good because the components do not form a whole which would not normally be offered for sale in separate parts.  See EN (IX) to GRI 3(b).  \r\rA determination of whether the detachable heels and soles and shoe cover become components of a set when packaged with the bowling shoes is guided by EN (X) to GRI 3(b), which states, in pertinent part: \r\rFor the purposes of this Rule, the term “goods put up in sets for retail sale” shall be taken to mean goods which: \r\rconsist of at least two different articles which are, prima facie, classifiable in different headings…;  \rconsist of products or articles put up together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity; and \rare put up in a manner suitable for sale directly to users without repacking (e.g., in boxes or cases or on boards).  \r\rIn your written submission, you concede that the subject merchandise satisfies the first and third criteria above.  However, you argue that the detachable heels and soles packaged with the bowling shoes, shoe bag, shoe cover and “sole and heel” bag do not satisfy the second criteria listed in the EN.  From the EN to GRI 3(b), you infer a requirement that the components of a set must be so related as to be clearly intended for use together or in conjunction with one another for a single purpose or activity.  As support, you point to an example to the EN to GRI 3(b), in which it is stated that a bottle of spirits (heading 22.08) and a bottle of wine (heading 22.04) packaged together would not be considered a set put up for retail sale in spite of the fact that they could be packaged for the activity of imbibing and served at the same occasion.  To complete your analogy, you argue that although the subject merchandise is intended to be used as footwear, the components making up the subject merchandise cannot be used together, thus precluding classification as a set put up for retail sale.  \r\rIt is noteworthy that the remaining examples set forth in the EN to GRI 3(b) respectively provide that hairdressing sets and drawing kits are both considered sets put up for retail sale.  Both exemplars contain components that are not used simultaneously.  However, because the components that make up hairdressing sets or drawing kits are used in conjunction with one another to such a high degree, those products are considered sets.  \r\rThe subject detachable heels and soles and bowling shoes are used in conjunction with each other for use as bowling footwear on different surfaces.  Such a use is more specialized than as ordinary footwear, which denotes a use on virtually any surface.  The user of the subject merchandise is instructed to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> the shoe cover on the “sliding shoe” when not walking on the bowling surface.  The user also receives instructions (located on the “sole and heel” bag, which also stores the interchangeable components when the merchandise is not in use) concerning which “slide sole” and heel combination enables the user to slide more or less depending on the bowling surface conditions and the individual’s bowling style.  All of the components of the subject merchandise are used in conjunction with each other to provide the user with the desired sliding effect while bowling.  The fact that some of the components are not attached to the shoes while the user is actively participating in bowling does not mean that they are not used in conjunction with each other to perform a specific activity.  As such, we find that they are goods put up in a set for retail sale.  See Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 964418, dated April 16, 2001; HQ 952654, dated January 27, 2003; and HQ 084712, dated August 24, 1989.  \r\rYou did not submit any cost data to us, but based on the complexity of constructing footwear, we will assume for the purposes of this ruling that the bowling shoes are the most costly component.  Likewise, the bowling shoes add the most bulk and weight to the set.  Moreover, as they are the component of the set that is worn while bowling, the bowling shoes provide the most important role in relation to the use of the goods.  Consequently, the bowling shoes impart the set with its essential character.  \rAccordingly, all of the aforementioned components, when imported together in the set, will be classifiable under subheading 6403.99.90, HTSUS.  \r\rHOLDING:\r\rBy application of GRI 3, the subject merchandise (style number B998-1) is classified in heading 6403, HTSUS, which provides for: “[f]ootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and upper of leather”.  The merchandise is specifically provided for in subheading 6403.99.9065, which provides for: “[f]ootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and upper of leather: Other footwear: Other: Other: Other: Other: For other persons: Valued over $2.50/pair, Other: Other: For women: Other.”  The column one, general rate of duty is 10 percent ad valorem.  \r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and subject to change.  The text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on the World Wide Web at www.usitc.gov.\r\rA copy of this ruling letter should be attached to the entry documents filed at the time the goods are entered. If the documents have been filed without a copy, this ruling should be brought to the attention of the CBP officer handling the transaction.\r\rSincerely,\r\r\r\rGail A.

Sullivan\rSullivan & Lynch, P.C.\r156 State Street\rBoston, Massachusetts 02109\r\rRE:  Modification of NY 862972, May 31, 1991; Classification of hinged knee support\r\rDear Mr. Sullivan: \r\rThis is in reference to New York Ruling Letter (NY) 862972 issued to you on May 31, 1991, in response to your letter of April 26, 1991 on behalf of Sports Products Marketing Inc. to the Director, Customs National Commodity Specialist Division in New York requesting a ruling on the classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) of certain Hummel Protect Support Products. \r\rPursuant to section 625(c), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S. C. 1625(c)), as amended by section 623 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186 (1993), notice of the proposed modification of NY 862972, as described below, was published in the Customs Bulletin, Volume 35, Number 42, on October 17, 2001.  The Customs Service received no comments during the notice and comment period that closed on November 16, 2001.  Customs, as the result of the disruption of mail service, waited two additional weeks until November 30, 2001 before proceeding with this reconsideration and modification.  No comments postmarked either before or after the close of the comment period were received.\r\rIn NY 862972, May 31, 1991, five protective support products were classified in various subheadings including 6212.90.0030, HTSUS, 9506.99.6080, HTSUS, and 9506.99.2000, HTSUS.  A hinged knee support was classified in subheading 6212.90.0030, HTSUS, which provides for brassieres, girdles, corsets, braces, suspenders, garters, and similar articles and parts thereof, whether or not knitted or crocheted, other; of man-made fibers or man-made fibers and rubber or plastics.  We have now had occasion to review that decision and found it to be in error insofar as the classification of the hinged knee support is concerned. This ruling letter modifies NY 862972 insofar as it concerns the classification of the hinged knee support. \r\rFACTS: \r\r\tThe merchandise under consideration consists of a hinged knee support made of neoprene covered by knit nylon fabric on both sides.  The knee support measures approximately 30 centimeters in length.  The tube-like support consists of two panels.  The back panel measures 9 centimeters across and has a 5-centimeter hole at the back of the knee.  At the top of the panel is a hook and loop adjustment strap.  The front panel covers the front and sides of the knee area.  It has a 3-centimeter hole at the knee, a wide hook and loop adjustment strap above the knee, and a narrow adjustment strap below the knee.  On each side of the knee there is a covered, hinged metal support.  The hinged supports run parallel to the leg, and measure approximately 26 centimeters in length.  You stated that the straps and hinges support the knee preventing “reinjury to a previously sensitive knee.” \t\r\t\rISSUE:\r\rWhether the hinged knee support is properly classifiable in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, which provides for orthopedic appliances and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability, Heading 9506, HTSUSA, which provides for articles and equipment for general physical exercise and other sports, Heading 6212, HTSUSA, brassieres, girdles, corsets, braces, suspenders, garters and similar articles and parts thereof or under Heading 6307, HTSUSA, which provides for other made up textile articles? \r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the Headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the Headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then be applied. \r\rThe hinged knee support is potentially classifiable in four HTSUSA headings.  One possible heading is Heading 9021, HTSUSA, which provides for orthopedic appliances and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability.  Other possible Headings for the merchandise include Heading 6212, HTSUSA, which provides for braces, Heading 9506, HTSUSA, which provides for articles and equipment for general physical exercise and other sports and Heading 6307, HTSUSA, which provides for other made up textile articles.\r\rHEADING 9021, HTSUSA \r\r\tHeading 9021, HTSUSA, provides for “Orthopedic appliances, including crutches, surgical belts and trusses; splints and other fracture appliances; artificial parts of the body; hearing aids and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability; parts and accessories thereof.” \r\rNote 1 (b) of Chapter 90 maintains:\r\rThis chapter does not cover supporting belts or other support articles of textile material, whose intended effect on the organ to be supported or held derives solely from their elasticity (for example, maternity belts, thoracic support bandages, abdominal support bandages, supports for joints or muscles (Section XI).   \r\rWhen interpreting and implementing the HTSUS, the Explanatory Notes (ENs) of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System may be utilized.  The ENs, while neither legally binding nor dispositive, provide a guiding commentary on the scope of each Heading, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the HTSUS. Customs believes the ENs should always be consulted.  See T.D. 89-90, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rThe ENs to Heading 9021 state that:\r\rThis Heading does not include supporting belts or other support articles of the kind referred to in Note 1 (b) to this Chapter,…(generally Heading 62.12 or 63.07).\r\rWhile the hinged knee support at issue is a support article of textile material, the metal springs support the joints and therefore the knee support’s intended effect on the organ to be supported does not derive solely from its elasticity.  Accordingly, the hinged knee support is not precluded from classification in heading 9021, HTSUSA, on that basis. \r\r\tAccording to Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, Edition 15, 1985, orthopedic is defined as “concerning orthopedics; prevention or correction of deformities.”  A deformity is defined by Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary as “an alteration in the natural form of a part or organ.  Distortion of any part or general disfigurement of the body.  It may be acquired or congenital.  If present after injury, usually implies the presence of fracture, dislocation or both.  May be due to extensive swelling, extravasation of blood or rupture of muscles.”  \r\rThe importer in the instant case is Sports Products Marketing, Inc.  Its products are generally utilized for the enhancement of an athlete’s performance and protection from injury during sport activities.  The importer does not describe the subject merchandise as being utilized to “prevent or correct bodily deformities.”  There is no mention of use of the hinged knee support in relation to the presence of fractures or dislocation.  The hinged knee support is described as preventing reinjury to a previously “sensitive knee.” \r\rProducts marketed to athletes to enhance performance are significantly distinguishable from items intended to be worn in order to function while recovering from a fracture or dislocation or to function in everyday life.  Accordingly, we believe the subject merchandise is not included in Heading 9021.  \r\rThe ENs to Heading 9021 state that the orthopedic appliances referred to in the heading are appliances for  “preventing or correcting bodily deformities” or “supporting or holding organs following an illness or operation.” The EN to Heading 9021 lists the type of orthopedic appliances that are included in that Heading as follows: \r\r1.  Appliances for hip diseases (coxalgia, etc.)\rHumerus splints (to enable use of an arm after resection), (extension splints).\r Appliances for the jaw. \r Traction, etc., appliances for the fingers.\r Appliances for treating Pott’s disease (straightening head and spine)\rOrthopaedic footwear, having enlarged leather stiffener, which may be reinforced with a metal or cork frame, made only to measure. \rSpecial insoles, made to measure.\rDental appliances for correcting deformities of the teeth (braces, rings, etc.) \rOrthopedic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> appliances (talipes appliances, leg braces, with or without spring support for the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, surgical boots, etc.).\r Trusses (inuinal, cural, umbilical, etc., trusses) and rupture appliances. \r Appliances for correcting scoliosis and curvature of the spine as well as all medical or surgical corsets and belts (including certain supporting belts) characterized by: \r\rSpecial pads, springs, etc., adjustable to fit the patient.\rThe materials of which they are made (leather, metal , plastic, etc.); or\rThe presence of reinforced parts, rigid pieces of fabric or bands of various widths. \r\rThe special design of these articles for a particular orthopedic purpose distinguishes them from ordinary corsets and belts, whether or not the latter also serve to support or hold.\r\r12.  Orthopedic suspenders (other than simple suspenders of knitted, netted or crocheted materials, etc.)   \r\rThe hinged knee support is not “ejusdem generis” or “of the same kind” of merchandise as the orthopedic appliances listed in Heading 9021. The merchandise at issue is not intended to be worn post-operation or to correct a bodily deformity but rather to be used to enhance performance during exercise or sports activities. The hinged knee support prevents common knee injuries and protects unstable knees. The opening helps stabilize the knee cap. The ENs state that the splints and other fracture appliances referenced in Heading 9021 may be used either to immobilize injured parts of the body or to set fractures.  While the knee support at issue may restrict movement, it does not immobilize the knee as contemplated in the EN to Heading 9021. [Emphasis added] See HQ 964317, dated May 1, 2001 (ruling that a knee brace made of 90 percent neoprene and 10 percent nylon or polyester and elastic with two hinged metal braces would be excluded from classification in Heading 9021 because it does not immobilize the knee); HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995, (ruling that a neoprene wrist support containing permanently inserted, rigid plastic support bars that were designed to immobilize the wrist in order to relieve tendinitis and prevent recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome were properly classifiable in 9021).  (Emphasis added) \r\rItems which may be used to prevent sprains or strains and to support the area of the body where they are worn are not considered to be of the class or kind of appliance used with recovery from bodily deformity or used following illnesses or operations of an incapacitating nature.  See NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991 (hinged knee support and back support with plastic stiffeners excluded from Heading 9021).  The appliances included, in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, e.g., appliances for hip disease, for correcting scoliosis and trusses (used generally for treating hernias) are similar in the sense that they enable the wearer to engage in the activities of everyday life.  The hinged knee support is not an item that is generally worn in order to function in everyday life but rather to engage in sports activities.  We note that orthopaedic footwear and special insoles might also be used by the wearer to engage in athletic activities but the EN provides that those items are made to measure and not marketed to a mass market as are the subject merchandise in the instant case. The fact that most, if not all, of the items referred to in the EN to Heading 9021 must be fitted to a particular individual is also a feature which the item at issue does not share with the enumerated articles. \r\rAlthough the hinged knee support would not be excluded from Heading 9021 because it  does not derive support solely from its elasticity, as discussed above, it is nonetheless not ejusdem generis with the exemplars in Heading 9021. \r\rHEADING 9506\r\rHaving precluded classification in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, we must determine whether classification in Heading 9506, HTSUSA is appropriate. Heading 9506, HTSUSA provides for, inter alia, articles and equipment for gymnastics, athletics, other sports and outdoor games\r\rThe ENs to Heading 9506 state in pertinent part: \r\rThis heading covers: \r\r* * *\r(B) Requisites for other sports and outdoor games (other than toys presented in sets, or separately of Heading 95.03), e.g.:\r\r* *\r(13) Protective equipment for sports or games, e.g., fencing masks and breast plates, elbow and knee pads, cricket pads, shin-guards.  \r\rThe sports protective equipment intended for inclusion within Heading 9506, HTSUSA, recognizes only such equipment designed exclusively for protection against injury, that is, equipment having protective features with the sole or primarily function of directly absorbing the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects.  See HQ 958791, dated May 13, 1996 (knee pads used for playing sports, elbow pads and wrist guards are classifiable in Heading 9506);  HQ 958387, dated April 8, 1996 (protective gear including knee and elbow pads used by in-line skaters to protect their knees, elbows and wrists against impact and abrasion are properly classifiable in Heading 9506);  HQ 957120, dated January 31, 1995  (ruling that wrist guards utilized for in line skating are classifiable under Heading 9506);  HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995 (ruling that  a hand/forearm pad, shin guards and elbow pad specifically designed to prevent injury while playing football or soccer are properly classifiable as protective sports equipment under Heading 9506); HQ 951406, dated July 13, 1992 (knee pads, elbow pads and wrist guards consisting of hard plastic cups and high impact plastic splint inserts, utilized for sporting activities have the primary function of protecting the wearer during sporting activities and are therefore properly classifiable in Heading 9506) [Emphasis added]; NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991 (a padded shin guard, specially designed to protect against leg blows in the game of soccer and an elbow support which primarily provides protection against blows or falls qualify for classification in Heading 9506 but a hinged knee support and a back support were excluded from Heading 9506 because neither of these items have as their sole or primary function to directly absorb the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects).  \r\rSignificantly, the hinged knee support at issue is described as neither a “pad” nor a “guard.”  Rather the item is called a “support.”  Nor is the hinged knee support designed with the sole or primary function of directly absorbing the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects.  Accordingly, Heading 9506, HTSUSA does not apply to the hinged knee support as its function is not to protect from impact imposed by blows, collisions or flying objects.\r\rHaving eliminated the possibility of classification under Heading 9021, HTSUSA and Heading 9506, HTSUSA, we must now determine whether the subject merchandise is properly classifiable in either chapter 62 as body supporting articles or in chapter 63 as other made up articles.\r\rHEADING 6212\r\rHeading 6212 provides for inter alia, braces. The ENs to Heading 6212, HTSUSA, state in pertinent part:\r\rThe Heading covers articles of a kind designed  for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> as body-supporting garments or as supports for certain other articles of apparel, and parts thereof…\r\rThe Heading includes, inter alia: \r\r(1) Brassieres of all kinds.\r(2) Girdles and panty-girdles.\r(3) Corselettes (combinations of girdles or panty-girdles and brassieres). \r(4) Corsets and corset belts.   These are usually reinforced with flexible metallic, whalebone or plastic stays, and are generally fastened by lacing or by hooks. \r(5) Suspender-belts, hygienic belts, supersensory bandages, suspender jock-straps braces, suspenders, garters, shirt-sleeve supporting arm-bands and armlets.\r(6) Body belts for men (including those combined with under pants)\r(7) Maternity, post-pregnancy or similar supporting corrective belts, not being orthopedic appliances of Heading 90.21.  \r\rThis office is of the opinion that the exemplars to Heading 6212 are united by the fact that they support apparel or other items (e.g. garters) or are garments (e.g. brassieres) and are generally worn underneath other garments as, for example, maternity belts or men’s body belts.  See HQ 952568, dated January 28, 1993; HQ 952390, dated December 16, 1992; HQ 952201, dated October 26, 1992.  The hinged knee brace, unlike the exemplars in the ENs to Heading 6212, is not worn as a garment or an  accessory to a garment and is therefore not properly classifiable in Heading 6212.  \r \rHEADING 6307\r\rHeading 6307, HTSUSA, is a residual provision which provides for other made up articles of textiles. Section Note 7 (e) of Section XI, which covers textiles and textile articles states in pertinent part as follows: \r\r7. For the purposes of this Section the expression “made up” means: \r\rAssembled by sewing…..\r\rThe instant article has been assembled by sewing, therefore they constitute made up textile articles.  The Explanatory Notes state regarding Heading 6307:\r\rThis Heading covers made up articles of any textile material which are not included more specifically in the Heading of Section XI or elsewhere in the Nomenclature. \r\rSince the hinged knee support at issue is not covered by any more specific heading, it is classifiable in Heading 6307, HTSUSA.\r\rThe ENs to 6307 specifically provide for articles such as the hinged knee support in Note (27) which notes that Heading 6307 includes, in particular: \r\rSupport articles of the kind referred to in Note 1 (b) to Chapter 90 for joints (e.g., knees, ankles, elbows or wrist) or muscles (e.g., thigh muscles), other than those falling in other Headings of Section XI. \r\t\r Customs has classified merchandise that is almost identical to the knee support at issue, knee braces with hinged support bars, under Heading 6307.   See 963534, dated August 29, 2001; HQ 964317, dated May 1, 2001; HQ 952568, dated January 28, 1993.  In addition, this ruling is consistent with several other rulings in which articles supporting joints or organs were classified in Heading 6307.  See HQ 958791, dated May 13, 1996 (revoking NY 840648 and classifying a knit elbow/knee support composed of 39 percent cotton and 61 percent man made fibers with ten magnets sewn into the supporter in Heading 6307); HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995 (ruling that adjustable neoprene knee supports which support the joint solely by means of their elasticity should remain classified in Heading 6307); HQ 952295, dated January 5, 1993 (ruling that a heel cup/anklet composed of neoprene and a soft flexible material such as molded rubber or thermoplastic was classifiable in Heading 6307); HQ 951844, dated September 4, 1992 (ruling that a pair of cotton/stretch nylon wristbands neither of which contained a protective insert or pad were classifiable in Heading 6307); HQ 952390, dated December 16, 1992 (ruling that a lumbar support belt with four or six covered metal vertical stays is classifiable in Heading 6307); NY E82026, dated June 16, 1999 (knee sleeve and wrist sleeve composed of neoprene rubber laminated on both sides with knit fabric classified in Heading 6307).\r\rWe note that in HQ 087552, dated  October 1, 1990 and HQ 086667, dated May 9, 1990, a knee stabilizer and a knee support respectively both composed of neoprene rubber laminated on both the inner and outer surfaces with knit nylon fabric were classified in Heading 6212, HTSUSA.  Also in NY A89561, dated December 11, 1996, ankle braces made of a heavy reinforced textile material for the purpose of providing ankle support for football players were classified in Heading 9021, HTSUSA.  Finally, in NY D88848, dated April 1, 1999,  a knee brace and a knee immobilizer worn only during sporting events by players to provide some support and to reduce the probability of reinjuring the knee joint were classified in Heading 9021, HTSUSA.   Appropriate steps are currently being taken to review these decisions and to modify and revoke those rulings as necessary. \r\rHOLDING: \r\rThe hinged knee support is properly classified in subheading 6307.90.9989, HTSUSA which provides for “Other made up articles, including dress patterns; Other; Other: Other: Other: Other.”  The general \rcolumn one rate of duty is 7 percent ad valorem.   There currently is no textile quota category applicable to this provision.  \r\rSincerely, \r\rJohn Durant, Director\rCommercial Rulings Division\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/2001/965234.doc"",""id"":18166,""rulingNumber"":""965234"",""subject"":""Modification of NY 862972, May 31, 1991; Classification of hinged knee support"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""2001-12-05T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""862972"",""964317"",""958190"",""958791"",""958387"",""957120"",""951406"",""952568"",""952390"",""952201"",""963534"",""840648"",""952295"",""951844"",""E82026"",""087552"",""086667"",""A89561"",""D88848""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[""862972""],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6307.90.9989""]}"

Your ruling request concerns the tariff classification of certain footwear incorporating Nike wearable technology (Nike Adapt BB) under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.  This ruling also takes into consideration information presented to CBP in your video conference of February 23, 2021 as well as the written supplement provided by your counsel on March 12, 2021.  \r\rFACTS:\r\r\tYou request a tariff classification ruling concerning certain Nike wearable technology, referred to as the Adapt BB, or “Adapt”.  In your request, you state that the Adapt platform consists of five primary components: (1) a Bluetooth® system-on-chip (SoC); (2) a sensor pack consisting of a gyroscope, accelerometer, and capacitive sensor; (3) system and subsystem components including three microcontroller unit (MCU) processors, flash memory and a wireless power receiver; (4) an auto-lacing platform with an optical quadrature rotary encoder and a low-resistance, high-torque, DC motor; and (5) a “performance basketball shoe” housing. \r\rAs imported, the Nike Adapt BB contains one pair of shoes (incorporating the above electronics components), a wireless charging pad, a USB cable/wall charger combo and operating manual packaged together for retail sale.  Below are two photographs\u0002 that are representative of the merchandise at issue in its condition as imported: \r\rImage 1\r\u0001\r\u0007Image 2\r\u0001\r\u0007\r\u0007\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhat is the tariff classification of the Nike Adapt BB?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tClassification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then be applied in their appropriate order.  \r\r\tIn your request, you indicate that the Adapt is a fitness platform, which combines wireless communication technology with sensing and fitness tracking, and packages it into auto-adjustable performance footwear.  The platform consists of five primary components: 1) a Bluetooth system on chip (SoC), 2) a sensor pack - gyroscope, accelerometer, and capacitive sensor, 3) system and subsystem components – microcontroller unit processors, flash memory and power receiver, 4) an auto lacing platform, optical quadrature rotary encoder, a DC motor, and (5) a performance basketball shoe housing.  You also provided a cost break-down of the product.\r\rYou note that the Adapt includes multiple components and functions that are not described under any single provision of the HTSUS.  You provide a description of the Adapt’s materials and components and their proposed classification as follows:\r\rBluetooth SoC – heading 85.17, which provides for telephone sets, including telephones for cellular networks or for other wireless networks; other apparatus for the transmission or reception of voice, images or other data, including apparatus for communication in a wired or wireless network (such as a local or wide area network, other than transmission or reception apparatus of heading 8443, 8525, 8527 or 8528; parts thereof;\r\rSensors – heading 90.31 which provides for measuring or checking instruments, appliances and machines, not specified or included elsewhere in this chapter; profile projectors; parts and accessories thereof;\r\rSystem Technologies:\r\rData Processing – heading 85.42 which provides for electronic integrated circuits; parts thereof;\rMemory – heading 85.23 which provides for discs, tapes, solid-state non-volatile storage devices, \""smart cards\"" and other media for the recording of sound or of other phenomena, whether or not recorded, including matrices and masters for the production of discs, but excluding products of Chapter\u00A037;\rAuto-fit technology – heading 85.01 which provides for electric motors and generators (excluding generating sets);\rWireless charging pad – heading 85.04 which provides for electrical transformers, static converters (for example, rectifiers) and inductors.\r\rShoe – heading 64.04 which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials.\r\rAccording to your submission, the value of the Bluetooth SoC, sensors, memory, and other electronic components, when taken together, constituted the largest percentage of landed costs when compared to the footwear base and packaging, although we note that the value of the electronic components is not further broken down.  \r\rBased on the above, it is your view that the Adapt is a good consisting of different materials and made up of different components. As such, classification cannot be done under any single provision of the HTSUS so we turn to GRI 2, which states that the classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of GRI 3.  See General Rule of Interpretation 2(b). Rule 3 reads:\r\rWhen by application of Rule 2\u00A0(b) or for any other reason, goods are\u00A0prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows:\r\rThe heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives \ra more complete or precise description of the goods.\u000B\rMixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3\u00A0(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable\r\rWhen goods cannot be classified by reference to 3\u00A0(a) or 3\u00A0(b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration\r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System (HS) at the international level.  While not legally binding, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HS and are thus useful in ascertaining the proper classification of merchandise.  It is CBP’s practice to follow, whenever possible, the terms of the ENs when interpreting the HTSUS. See T.D. 89-90, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).  The Explanatory Note to GRI 3(b) states:\r\r(VII)\u00A0 In all these cases the goods are to be classified as if they consisted of the material or component\u00A0which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.\r\u00A0\r(VIII) The factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods. It may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of a constituent material in relation to the use of the goods.\r\u00A0\r(IX)\u00A0\u00A0 For the purposes of this Rule, composite goods made up of different components shall be taken to mean not only those in which the components are attached to each other to form a practically inseparable whole but also those with separable components,\u00A0provided\u00A0these components are adapted one to the other and are mutually complementary and that together they form a whole which would not normally be offered for sale in separate parts.\r\rYou argue in your request that the Adapt cannot be classified solely by application of GRI 1. With respect to GRI 3(b), you contend that the essential character of the good is imparted by the Bluetooth transceiver and therefore the Adapt is classified under subheading 8517.62, and more specifically, subheading 8517.62.00, HTSUS, which provides for other machines for the reception, conversion, and transmission or regeneration of  “Telephone sets, including telephones for cellular networks or for other wireless networks; other apparatus for the transmission or reception of voice, images or other data, including apparatus for communication in a wired or wireless network (such as a local or wide area network), other than transmission or reception apparatus of heading 8443, 8525, 8527 or 8528; parts thereof:  Other apparatus for transmission or reception of voice, images or other data, including apparatus for communication in a wired or wireless network (such as a local or wide area network):  Machines for the reception, conversion and transmission or regeneration of voice, images or other data, including switching and routing apparatus.”  You note that the component which imparts “essential character” will “vary as between different kinds of goods,” but is generally understood to be the component “which is indispensable to the structure, core or condition of the article, i.e., what it is.” Structural Industries v. United States, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1330, 1336 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2005).\r\rYou believe that the Adapt’s transceiving subsystem imparts its essential character and argue that it is indispensable to the Adapt’s core and condition.  These components make the article “what it is” in the eyes of the consumer.  In support of this, you cite several rulings issued by CBP pertaining to wrist-worn “smart” devices, which monitor health and provide the user data on physical activities.\u0002  You state that the Adapt has many of the same capabilities as these wrist-wearable devices.  At our February 23, 2021 meeting, you cited other rulings which goods with embedded Bluetooth modules are classified in heading 8517, HTSUS, despite the fact that they have utilitarian functions.\u0002  You are also of the view that the Adapt platform's commercial value is unlocked by its Bluetooth transceiver. You note that the expansive functionality offered by the Adapt is reflected in product costs and retail values that are significantly higher than those of analog footwear.  In your view, the footwear constituents of the Adapt account for a minor portion of the total costs, on the other hand, because they are essentially the housing for the electronic system.  \r\rIn your view, the prior rulings on wrist-wearable smart devices referred to in your request, along with others, demonstrate four key points with respect to the Adapt: (1)\u00A0devices with the particular connectivity features of the Adapt are classified in heading 8517; (2) limited display does not disqualify a device from classification in heading 8517; (3) devices with comparable technical specifications to the Adapt are classified in heading 8517; and (4) and the location of a wearable device on the body is immaterial to classification in heading 8517. Additionally, the Adapt is distinguishable from composite footwear, which CBP has previously classified as footwear.  CBP has previously classified wearable devices with connectivity features nearly identical to those of the Adapt in heading 8517 pursuant to GRI\u00A03\u00A0(b).\r\rYou also distinguish the Adapt from other cases where CBP classified composite <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>-wearable products according to their footwear components, such as dusters, lights or GPS tracking devices.\u0002  In your view, those rulings only contained two simple components that performed a distinct task. The Adapt contains numerous components performing various interrelated tasks to support the product's overall use as a wearable multifunctional device. Footwear incorporating a single duster, light, or GPS tracker simply cannot be analogized to a product that includes motors, sensors, a microcontroller, memory, and a transceiver.  You also point to CBP’s classification of slippers incorporating a vibrating massaging unit as massage apparatus of heading 9019, HTSUS\u0002, noting that, like the Adapt' s technology components, the massage element could not be removed from the product and that, like the Adapt's footwear component, the slipper functioned to hold the massage unit in place on the user's <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.\r\rFinally, you provide guidance provided to Nike from the Customs authority of Belgium, classifying the Adapt under heading 8517.  Acknowledging that although the classification positions of other customs agencies are not binding on CBP, they are instructive and entitled to “respectful consideration” given the importance of ensuring uniformity in the interpretation of the HS at the international level. \r\rIn conclusion, you summarize that the Adapt is designed for use as a wearable electronic device. The product's electronic components predominate by cost and drive a substantial increase in retail value over a comparable product which lacks electronic components. The primary purpose of the electronic components is to interact with apps on a paired wireless device or with devices in the internet of things.  Accordingly, you conclude that “it is the wireless Bluetooth transceiver that enables the user to fully access all of the [Adapt's] functionality” and it is the wireless Bluetooth transceiver that unlocks the Adapt's full retail value. Taking the above into consideration, you propose that classification of the Adapt is under subheading 8517.62.00, HTSUS.\r\rWith regard to the legal basis of classification, we agree that GRI 1 does not resolve the classification of the Adapt for the reasons you put forth.  Utilizing the subsequent GRI’s, we arrive at GRI 3(b), as do you, which provides instruction on the classification of, inter alia, composite goods made up of different components.  In such cases, classification of composite goods is controlled by the component of the product that gives it its essential character.  However, for the reasons set forth below, it is our conclusion that the essential character is imparted by the Adapt footwear rather than the Bluetooth transceiver, as you conclude.\r\rYou describe the Nike Adapt BB in your ruling request and related submissions as a wearable electronic device designed to provide consumers with a connected experience supported by online content.  The actual imported item is athletic footwear in the form of a basketball shoe.  The brief description of the footwear states that the upper is constructed out of synthetic knit and features a foam sole.  The outer sole unit will contain the sensor pack, Bluetooth chip, system components, and an auto-lacing platform in the upper.  The basketball shoe containing the physical technological components is considered a composite good that will be imported as a set with a wireless battery charging pad/mat.  \r\rYou cite to other CBP rulings involving wearable “smart” devices that utilize Bluetooth and share several features of the Adapt, including fitness and location tracking.  These devices were ultimately classified under heading 8517, HTSUS, as apparatus for communication in a wired or wireless network.  However, there are significant differences between those products and the Adapt.  The devices you cite to, generally referred to as “smart watches”, are worn on the user’s wrist and in most of the cases, despite their name, cannot set the correct time themselves unless they are paired with a “host” device, such as a computer or laptop, tablet computer or mobile phone.  These wearable smart-devices not only gather data and transmit it to the host device, but interact directly with the user through touch, sight and sound (ex., display screen with or without touch-sensitivity, speakers, haptics).  They contain their own mobile operating system (OS) and can perform functions such as sending and receiving text messages, emails, mobile telephone calls, and remotely control music, to name a few.\r\rAs you noted, under GRI 3(b), composite goods must be classified according to the material or component that imparts the article with its essential character.  The “essential character” of an article is “that which is indispensable to the structure, core or condition of the article, i.e., what it is.” Structural Industries v. United States, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1330, 1336 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2005).  In this case, the shoe imparts the essential character.  Although the Adapt may enable the wearer to enhance his or her experience via a smartphone or other device, the wearer must actually <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them and use them as footwear.  If the wearer chooses to enable some or many of the additional features or capabilities, that is his or her option; that is the way the Adapt platform will gather data and subsequently transmit data to the user.  However, the wearer will always use the Adapt as footwear.  \r\rAs you note in your request, CBP has historically and consistently classified footwear with electronic modules and components, and battery components, as part of massaging, light-up, heating, and sound-emitting footwear in Chapter 64. \r\rHQ W968135, dated October 3, 2006, concerned slippers incorporating light and weight sensors in them that activated LED light bulbs, embedded in the toes. The bulbs in each slipper were angled upward and illuminated an area 20-25 feet in front of the wearer when activated.  Each slipper was powered by two lithium batteries contained in a compartment on the medial side.  In both NY N237859, dated February 4, 2013, and NY N127780, dated November 4, 2010, footwear contained batteries and bulbs which allowed the shoes to light up or flash when making contact with the ground.  In NY N289089, dated August 31, 2017, electronic, battery operated novelty shoes contained a speaker and a circuit board enabled a sound to be emitted when activated by the wearer.  \r\rIn NY N007520, dated March 19, 2007, slippers contained a portable battery powered charger used to heat the items prior to use.  The electrical heating unit in the soles of the slippers could be plugged into the charging unit, warming the slippers to 40-degrees Celsius.  Ruling N165336, dated June 6, 2011, featured a lace-up hiking boot with a battery powered heating system, which included two lithium-polymer batteries, two USB charging cables, an AC charger, and a control electronics box.  These electrical parts, except for the control electronics box, were imported in a separate box within the same box containing the boots.  The pair of boots accompanied by the electrical parts constituted a set classifiable at the rate applicable to the classification of the boots.\r\rNY N244135, dated August 15, 2013, featured therapeutic massage sandals.  Massaging “fingers” applied to the inner soles provided stimulation to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> when the sandals were worn.  NY L87810, dated October 11, 2005, were manufactured with massaging insoles.  These sandals were classified in Chapter 64 as footwear.  \r\rFurther, as you note, not all footwear incorporating massaging apparatus were classified as footwear.  In HQ 960032 dated December 6, 1999, the “massaging slipper” consisted of two components a slipper and a battery-powered massaging mechanism, which together comprised a composite good.  In this case, the slipper functioned as the component of the apparatus which held the massaging component in place, allowing massage to be applied to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>. Additionally, in HQ 967179 dated October 15, 2004, dealt with certain slippers incorporating battery controlled massaging mechanisms.  In this ruling, it was found that the primary purpose of the goods was to provide the user with a heated massage.  The massaging mechanism imparted the essential character of the items, and were classified accordingly.\r\rUnder the HTSUS, it has been established that the factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods.  It may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of a constituent material in relation to the use of the goods.  There have been several court decisions on “essential character” for purposes of classification under GRI 3(b), several of which have been touched upon above.  See Conair Corp. v. United States, 29 C.I.T. 888 (2005); Structural Industries v. United States, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1330, 1337-1338 (C.I.T. 2005); and Home Depot USA, Inc. v. United States, 427 F. Supp. 2d 1278, 1295-1356 (C.I.T. 2006), aff’d by 491 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (“essential character is that which is indispensable to the structure, core or condition of the article, i.e., what it is.”) (quoting A.N. Deringer, Inc. v. United States, 66 Cust. Ct. 378, 383 (1971)).  In particular, the court stated “[a]n essential character inquiry requires a fact intensive analysis.”  Id. at 1284.  \r\rLooking again at the product at issue, we note that the Bluetooth SoC is just one of the electronic components of the Adapt.  This article provides wireless capability to the module, which is in turn also incorporated within the footwear.  In our view, the act of providing wireless connectivity supports the primary function of the electronic module, which is imparted by the fitness sensors or the auto-lacing platform.  The act of wirelessly exchanging that data with a host device is a support or secondary function.  The function of the Bluetooth chip, in theory, could be replaced by a wire, but there is no way to replace the sensor assembly, it is the component that proves to be indispensable.  This makes it clear that the wireless function is a support function and not the essential character when viewing the electronic module on its own.  \r\rWearable “smart” technology is a growing segment of the marketplace.  Without a doubt, these types of goods will require individual, or case-by-case, analyses in order to determine their essential character.  Regarding the Adapt, it is clear that the basketball shoe is indispensable for the engagement of all of the “experience” options offered by the additional components.  It predominates in size, weight, function (if not the cost) and delivers the experience of walking, running, and training as compared with the ancillary use of the technological features.  Unlike the wrist-wearable smart devices you cite in your request, whose value to the user comes from the information they convey, the Adapt serves a utilitarian function that provides the value to the user while the information conveyed supplements that usefulness.  As such, the Adapt is an article of footwear classified under heading 6404, HTSUS.  \r\rIn conclusion, based on the above, the Nike Adapt BB, is classified under subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUS, as footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials, tennis, shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like: other: valued over $12/pair.  \r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tBy application of GRI 3(b), the Nike Adapt BB is classified in heading 6404, HTSUS, and is specifically provided for by application of GRI 6 under subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUS, as footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials, tennis, shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like: other: valued over $12/pair.  The general, column one rate of duty will be 20 percent ad valorem.\r\rPursuant to U.S. Note 20 to Subchapter III, Chapter 99, HTSUS, products of China classified under subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUS, unless specifically excluded, are subject to an additional 7.5 percent ad valorem rate of duty.\u00A0 At the time of importation, you must report the Chapter 99 subheading, i.e., 9903.88.15, in addition to subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUS, listed above.\r\rThe HTSUS is subject to periodic amendment, so you should exercise reasonable care in monitoring the status of goods covered by the Note cited above and the applicable Chapter 99 subheading.\u00A0 For background information regarding the trade remedy initiated pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, including information on exclusions and their effective dates, you may refer to the relevant parts of the USTR and CBP websites, which are available at https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/enforcement/section-301-investigations/tariff-actions and https://www.cbp.gov/trade/remedies/301-certain-products-china respectively. \r\rThe text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on the World Wide Web at http://www.usitc.gov/.  \r\rA copy of this ruling letter should be attached to the entry documents filed at the time the goods are entered.

Previti\rReebok International Ltd.\r100 Technology Center Drive\rStoughton, MA 02072\r\rRE:  Revocation of NY A89561, December 11, 1996; Classification of an ankle brace\r\rDear Ms. Previti:  \r\rThis is in reference to New York Ruling Letter (NY) A89561 issued to you on December 11, 1996, in response to your letter of November 15, 1996 to the Director, Customs National Commodity Specialist Division in New York, requesting classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) of an ankle brace. \r\rPursuant to section 625(c), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S. C. 1625(c)), as amended by section 623 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186 (1993), notice of the proposed revocation of \rNY A89561, as described below, was published in the Customs Bulletin, Volume 35, Number 42, on October 17, 2001.  The Customs Service received no comments during the notice and comment period that closed on November 16, 2001.  Customs, as the result of the disruption of mail service, waited two additional weeks until November 30, 2001 before proceeding with this reconsideration and revocation.  No comments postmarked either before or after the close of the comment period were received.\r\rIn NY A89561, dated December 11, 1996, an ankle brace was classified under subheading 9021.19.8500, HTSUSA, which provides for orthopedic appliances, including crutches, surgical belts and trusses; splints and other fracture appliances; artificial parts of the body; hearing aids and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability; parts and accessories thereof: artificial joints and other orthopedic or fracture appliances; parts and accessories thereof: Other: Other.  We have now had occasion to review that decision and found it to be in error.  This ruling letter revokes NY A89561, dated December 11, 1996. \r\rFACTS: \r\r\tThe merchandise under consideration consists of an ankle brace, which resembles the upper part of a laced up boot and is made of a heavy reinforced textile material.   According to your letter, the ankle braces are designed for use by football players as ankle support.  The ankle brace was classified in subheading 9021.19.8500, HTSUSA which provides for orthopedic appliances, including crutches, surgical belts and trusses; splints and other fracture appliances; artificial parts of the body; hearing aids and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability; parts and accessories thereof: artificial joints and other orthopedic or fracture appliances; parts and accessories thereof: Other: Other. \r\rISSUE:\r\rWhether the ankle brace is properly classifiable in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, which provides for orthopedic appliances and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability, Heading 9506, HTSUSA, which provides for articles and equipment for general physical exercise and other sports, Heading 6212, HTSUSA, brassieres, girdles, corsets, braces, suspenders, garters and similar articles and parts thereof or under Heading 6307, HTSUSA, which provides for other made up textile articles? \r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the Headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the Headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then be applied. \r\rThe ankle brace is potentially classifiable in four HTSUSA headings. One possible heading is Heading 9021, HTSUSA, which provides for orthopedic appliances and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability.  Other possible Headings for the merchandise include Heading 6212, HTSUSA, which provides for braces, Heading 9506, HTSUSA, which provides for articles and equipment for general physical exercise and other sports or Heading 6307, HTSUSA, which provides for other made up textile articles.\r\rHEADING 9021, HTSUSA \r\r\tHeading 9021, HTSUSA, provides for “Orthopedic appliances, including crutches, surgical belts and trusses; splints and other fracture appliances; artificial parts of the body; hearing aids and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability; parts and accessories thereof.” \r\r\rNote 1 (b) of Chapter 90 maintains:\r\rThis chapter does not cover supporting belts or other support articles of textile material, whose intended effect on the organ to be supported or held derives solely from their elasticity (for example, maternity belts, thoracic support bandages, abdominal support bandages, supports for joints or muscles (Section XI).   \r\rWhen interpreting and implementing the HTSUS, the Explanatory Notes (ENs) of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System may be utilized.  The ENs, while neither legally binding nor dispositive, provide a guiding commentary on the scope of each Heading, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the HTSUS. Customs believes the ENs should always be consulted.  See T.D. 89-90, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rThe ENs to Heading 9021 state that:\r\rThis Heading does not include supporting belts or other support articles of the kind referred to in Note 1 (b) to this Chapter,…(generally Heading 62.12 or 63.07).\r\rThe ankle brace at issue does not solely depend on elasticity to support the ankle joint and, therefore, would not be precluded from classification in heading 9021 on the basis of Note 1 (b) of Chapter 90. \r\r\tAccording to Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, Edition 15, 1985, orthopedic is defined as “concerning orthopedics; prevention or correction of deformities.”  A deformity is defined by Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary as “an alteration in the natural form of a part or organ.  Distortion of any part or general disfigurement of the body.  It may be acquired or congenital.  If present after injury, usually implies the presence of fracture, dislocation or both.  May be due to extensive swelling, extravasation of blood or rupture of muscles.”  \r\rYou stated in your original letter that the ankle brace is designed for use by football players to enhance performance and protect from injury during sport activities.  You did not describe the subject merchandise as being utilized to “prevent or correct bodily deformities.”  There is no mention of use of the brace at issue in relation to the presence of fractures or dislocation.  \r\r\r\rIn addition, Reebok International, Ltd. does not focus on the healthcare market but rather the sports gear/sports equipment market.   Reebok International’s website does not feature medical or healthcare products but rather focuses on athletic shoes and apparel.  Accordingly, we do not believe the subject merchandise is the type of orthopedic appliance described by Heading 9021, HTSUSA.  \r\rThe ENs to Heading 9021 state that the orthopedic appliances referred to in the heading are appliances for  “preventing or correcting bodily deformities” or “supporting or holding organs following an illness or operation.” The EN to Heading 9021 lists the type of orthopedic appliances that are included in that Heading as follows: \r\r1.

Orthopedic suspenders (other than simple suspenders of knitted, netted or crocheted materials, etc.)   \r\rThe description of the ankle brace at issue indicates that it is not “ejusdem generis” or “of the same kind” of merchandise as orthopedic appliances listed in Heading 9021.  The merchandise at issue is not intended to be worn post-operation or to correct a bodily deformity but rather to be used to enhance performance during exercise or sports activities. The ENs state that the splints and other fracture appliances referenced in Heading 9021 may be used either to immobilize injured parts of the body or to set fractures.  While the ankle braces at issue may restrict movement, they do not immobilize the ankle as contemplated in the EN to Heading 9021. [Emphasis added] See HQ 964317, dated May 1, 2001 (ruling that a knee brace made of 90 percent neoprene and 10 percent nylon or polyester and elastic with two hinged metal braces would be excluded from classification in Heading 9021 because it does not immobilize the knee); HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995, (ruling that a neoprene wrist support containing permanently inserted, rigid plastic support bars that were designed to immobilize the wrist in order to relieve tendinitis and prevent recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome were properly classifiable in 9021).  (Emphasis added) \r\rThese items which may be used to prevent sprains or strains and to support the area of the body where they are worn are not considered to be of the class or kind of appliance used with recovery from bodily deformity or used following illnesses or operations of an incapacitating nature.  See NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991 (hinged knee support and back support with plastic stiffeners excluded from Heading 9021).  The appliances included in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, e.g., appliances for hip disease, for correcting scoliosis and trusses (used generally for treating hernias) are similar in the sense that they enable the wearer to engage in the activities of everyday life.  The ankle brace is clearly not an item that is generally worn in order to function in everyday life but rather to engage in sports activities.  We note that orthopaedic footwear and special insoles might also be used by the wearer to engage in athletic activities but the EN provides that those items are made to measure and not marketed to a mass market as are the subject merchandise in the instant case. The fact that most, if not all, of the items referred to in the EN to Heading 9021 must be fitted to a particular individual is also a feature which the items at issue do not share with the enumerated articles. \r\rAlthough the ankle brace would not be excluded from Heading 9021 because it does not derive support solely from its elasticity, as discussed above, the item is nonetheless not esjudem generis with the exemplars in Heading 9021. \r\rHEADING 9506\r\rHaving precluded classification in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, we must determine whether classification in Heading 9506, HTSUSA is appropriate. Heading 9506, HTSUSA provides for, inter alia, articles and equipment for gymnastics, athletics, other sports and outdoor games\r\rThe ENs to Heading 9506 state in pertinent part: \r\rThis heading covers: \r\r* * *\r(B) Requisites for other sports and outdoor games (other than toys presented in sets, or separately of Heading 95.03), e.g.:\r\r* *\r(13) Protective equipment for sports or games, e.g., fencing masks and breast plates, elbow and knee pads, cricket pads, shin-guards.  \r\rThe sports protective equipment intended for inclusion within Heading 9506, HTSUSA, recognizes only that equipment which is designed exclusively for protection against injury, that is equipment having protective features with the sole or primarily function of directly absorbing the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects.  See HQ 958791, dated May 13, 1996 (knee pads used for playing sports, elbow pads and wrist guards are classifiable in Heading 9506);  HQ 958387, dated April 8, 1996 (protective gear including knee and elbow pads used by in-line skaters to protect their knees, elbows and wrists against impact and abrasion are properly classifiable in Heading 9506);  HQ 957120, dated January 31, 1995  (ruling that wrist guards utilized for in line skating are classifiable under Heading 9506);  HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995 (ruling that  a hand/forearm pad, shin guards and elbow pad specifically designed to prevent injury while playing football or soccer are properly classifiable as protective sports equipment under Heading 9506); HQ 951406, dated July 13, 1992 (knee pads, elbow pads and wrist guards consisting of hard plastic cups and high impact plastic splint inserts, utilized for sporting activities have the primary function of protecting the wearer during sporting activities and are therefore properly classifiable in Heading 9506) [Emphasis added]; NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991 (a padded shin guard, specially designed to protect against leg blows in the game of soccer and an elbow support which primarily provides protection against blows or falls qualify for classification in Heading 9506 but a hinged knee support and a back support were excluded from Heading 9506 because neither of these items have as their sole or primary function to directly absorb the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects).  \r\rSignificantly, the ankle brace at issue is described as neither a “pad” nor a “guard.”  Nor is the ankle brace designed with the sole or primary function of directly absorbing the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects.  Accordingly, Heading 9506, HTSUSA does not apply to the knee support as its function is not to protect from impact imposed by blows, collisions or flying objects.\r\rHaving eliminated the possibility of classification under Heading 9021, HTSUSA and Heading 9506, HTSUSA, we must now determine whether the subject merchandise is properly classifiable in either chapter 62 as body supporting articles or in chapter 63 as other made up articles.\r\rHEADING 6212\r\rHeading 6212 provides for inter alia, braces. The ENs to Heading 6212, HTSUSA, state in pertinent part:\r\rThe Heading covers articles of a kind designed  for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> as body-supporting garments or as supports for certain other articles of apparel, and parts thereof…\r\rThe Heading includes, inter alia: \r\r(1) Brassieres of all kinds.\r(2) Girdles and panty-girdles.\r(3) Corselettes (combinations of girdles or panty-girdles and brassieres). \r(4) Corsets and corset belts.   These are usually reinforced with flexible metallic, whalebone or plastic stays, and are generally fastened by lacing or by hooks. \r(5) Suspender-belts, hygienic belts, supersensory bandages, suspender jock-straps braces, suspenders, garters, shirt-sleeve supporting arm-bands and armlets.\r(6) Body belts for men (including those combined with under pants)\r(7) Maternity, post-pregnancy or similar supporting corrective belts, not being orthopedic appliances of Heading 90.21.  \r\rThis office is of the opinion that the exemplars to Heading 6212 are united by the fact that they support apparel or other items (e.g. garters) or are garments (e.g. brassieres) and are generally worn underneath other garments as, for example, maternity belts or men’s body belts.  See HQ 952568, dated January 28, 1993; HQ 952390, dated December 16, 1992; HQ 952201, dated October 26, 1992.  The ankle brace, unlike the exemplars in the ENs to Heading 6212, is not worn as a garment or an accessory to a garment and is therefore not properly classifiable in Heading 6212.  \r \rHEADING 6307\r\rHeading 6307, HTSUSA, is a residual provision which provides for other made up articles of textiles. Section Note 7 (e) of Section XI, which covers textiles and textile articles states in pertinent part as follows: \r\r7. For the purposes of this Section the expression “made up” means: \r\rAssembled by sewing…..\r\rThe instant article has been assembled by sewing, therefore they constitute made up textile articles.  The Explanatory Notes state regarding Heading 6307:\r\rThis Heading covers made up articles of any textile material which are not included more specifically in the Heading of Section XI or elsewhere in the Nomenclature. \r\rSince the ankle brace at issue is not covered by any more specific heading it is classifiable in Heading 6307, HTSUSA.\r\rThe ENs to 6307 specifically provide for articles such as the knee support in Note (27) which notes that Heading 6307 includes, in particular: \r\rSupport articles of the kind referred to in Note 1 (b) to Chapter 90 for joints (e.g., knees, ankles, elbows or wrist) or muscles (e.g., thigh muscles), other than those falling in other Headings of Section XI. \r\t\r This ruling is consistent with several other rulings in which articles supporting joints or organs were classified in Heading 6307.  See HQ 963534, dated August 29, 2001, HQ 964317, dated May 1, 2001; See HQ 958791, dated May 13, 1996 (revoking NY 840648 and classifying a knit elbow/knee support composed of 39 percent cotton and 61 percent man- made fibers with ten magnets sewn into the supporter in Heading 6307); HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995 (ruling that adjustable neoprene knee supports which support the joint solely by means of their elasticity should remain classified in Heading 6307); HQ 952568, dated January 28, 1993 (knee brace with hinged support bars classified in Heading 6307); HQ 952295, dated January 5, 1993 (ruling that a heel cup/anklet composed of neoprene and a soft flexible material such as molded rubber or thermoplastic was classifiable in Heading 6307); HQ 951844, dated September 4, 1992 (ruling that a pair of cotton/stretch nylon wristbands neither of which contained a protective insert or pad were classifiable in Heading 6307); HQ 952390, dated December 16, 1992 (ruling that a lumbar support belt with four or six covered metal vertical stays is classifiable in Heading 6307); NY E82026, dated June 16, 1999 (knee sleeve and wrist sleeve composed of neoprene rubber laminated on both sides with knit fabric classified in Heading 6307).\r\rWe note that in NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991, knee supports with hinges, were classified in Heading 6212, HTSUSA.   In HQ 087552, dated  October 1, 1990 and HQ 086667, dated May 9, 1990, a knee stabilizer, and a knee support respectively both composed of neoprene rubber laminated on both the inner and outer surfaces with knit nylon fabric were classified in Heading 6212, HTSUSA.  Finally, in NY D88848, dated April 1, 1999,  a knee brace and a knee immobilizer worn only during sporting events by players to provide some support and to reduce the probability of reinjuring the knee joint were classified in Heading 9021, HTSUSA.   Appropriate steps are currently being taken to review these decisions and to modify and revoke those rulings as necessary. \r\rHOLDING: \r\rThe ankle brace is properly classified in subheading 6307.90.9989, HTSUSA which provides for “Other made up articles, including dress patterns; Other; Other: Other: Other: Other.”  The general column one rate\rof duty is 7 percent ad valorem.   There currently is no textile quota category applicable to this provision.  \r\rSincerely, \r\r\r\rJohn Durant, Director\rCommercial Rulings Division\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/2001/965238.doc"",""id"":18170,""rulingNumber"":""965238"",""subject"":""Revocation of NY A89561, December 11, 1996; Classification of an ankle brace"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""2001-12-05T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""A89561"",""964317"",""958190"",""862972"",""958791"",""958387"",""957120"",""951406"",""952568"",""952390"",""952201"",""963534"",""840648"",""952295"",""951844"",""E82026"",""087552"",""086667"",""D88848""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[""A89561""],""tariffs"":[""6307.90.9989""]}"

L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186 (1993), notice of the proposed modification of NY D88848, as described below, was published in the Customs Bulletin, Volume 35, Number 42, on October 17, 2001.  The Customs Service received no comments during the notice and comment period that closed on November 16, 2001.  Customs, as the result of the disruption of mail service, waited two additional weeks until November 30, 2001 before proceeding with this reconsideration and modification.  No comments postmarked either before or after the close of the comment period were received.\r\rIn NY D88848, April 1, 1999, both a knee brace and a knee immobilizer were classified under subheading 9021.19.8500, HTSUSA, which provides for orthopedic appliances, including crutches, surgical belts and trusses; splints and other fracture appliances; artificial parts of the body; hearing aids and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability; parts and accessories thereof: Artificial joints and other orthopedic or fracture appliances; parts and accessories thereof: Artificial joints and parts and accessories thereof: Other: Other.  We have now had occasion to review that decision and found it to be in error insofar as the classification of the knee brace and knee immobilizer are concerned. \r\rFACTS: \r\r\tThe merchandise under consideration consists of a knee brace, item number N-KN-56, and a knee immobilizer, item number T-KN-73.  The knee brace, item number N-KN-56 is constructed of neoprene laminated on both the inner and outer surface with nylon knit fabric.  It is designed with an opening at the knee for patella support.  It has two straps which fasten around the knee joint by means of strips similar to the VELCRO brand loop fastener.   There are two sleeves, one on each side of the brace, containing a plastic hinged bar to give added stability and support.   \r\r\tThe knee immobilizer, item number T-KN-73, is made of foam rubber laminated on the outer surface with brush knit fabric and the inner surface with a knit fabric.  The interior side features a thick foam cushion in the center and foam strips, one on each side.  It is held closed with a removable panel made of the same material, one on each exterior side.  The panels feature a sleeve with metal stay and strips similar to the VELCRO brand fastener.  It is designed to wrap around the knee.   \r\r\tRegarding both items, the advertising on one of the packages indicates that it is worn only during sporting events by players to provide some support and thus reduce the probability of re-injuring the knee joint. \r\rISSUE:\r\rWhether the knee brace and knee immobilizer are properly classifiable in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, which provides for orthopedic appliances and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability, Heading 9506, HTSUSA, which provides for articles and equipment for general physical exercise and other sports, Heading 6212, HTSUSA, brassieres, girdles, corsets, braces, suspenders, garters and similar articles and parts thereof or under heading 6307, HTSUSA, which provides for other made up textile articles? \r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the Headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the Headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then be applied. \r\rThe knee brace and immobilizer are potentially classifiable in four HTSUSA headings.  One possible heading is Heading 9021, HTSUSA, which provides for orthopedic appliances and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability.  Other possible Headings for the merchandise include Heading 6212, HTSUSA, which provides for braces, Heading 9506, HTSUSA, which provides for articles and equipment for general physical exercise and other sports or Heading 6307, HTSUSA, which provides for other made up textile articles.\r\rHEADING 9021, HTSUSA \r\r\tHeading 9021, HTSUSA, provides for “Orthopedic appliances, including crutches, surgical belts and trusses; splints and other fracture appliances; artificial parts of the body; hearing aids and other appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the body, to compensate for a defect or disability; parts and accessories thereof.” \r\rNote 1 (b) of Chapter 90 maintains:\r\rThis chapter does not cover supporting belts or other support articles of textile material, whose intended effect on the organ to be supported or held derives solely from their elasticity (for example, maternity belts, thoracic support bandages, abdominal support bandages, supports for joints or muscles (Section XI).   \r\rWhen interpreting and implementing the HTSUS, the Explanatory Notes (ENs) of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System may be utilized.  The ENs, while neither legally binding nor dispositive, provide a guiding commentary on the scope of each Heading, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the HTSUS. Customs believes the ENs should always be consulted.  See T.D. 89-90, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rThe ENs to Heading 9021 state that:\r\rThis Heading does not include supporting belts or other support articles of the kind referred to in Note 1 (b) to this Chapter,…(generally Heading 62.12 or 63.07).\r\rThe knee brace and immobilizer at issue do not solely depend on elasticity to support the knee joint and, therefore, would not be precluded from classification in heading 9021 on the basis of Note 1 (b) of Chapter 90.  \r\r\tAccording to Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, Edition 15, 1985, orthopedic is defined as “concerning orthopedics; prevention or correction of deformities.”  A deformity is defined by Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary as “an alteration in the natural form of a part or organ.  Distortion of any part or general disfigurement of the body.  It may be acquired or congenital.  If present after injury, usually implies the presence of fracture, dislocation or both.  May be due to extensive swelling, extravasation of blood or rupture of muscles.”  \r\rThe packaging of both the knee brace and the knee immobilizer indicates that they are to be worn only during sporting events by players to provide some support and therefore reduce the possibility of reinjuring the knee joint.  The merchandise is not described as being utilized to “prevent or correct bodily deformities.”  There is no mention of use of either the brace or the immobilizer at issue in relation to the presence of fractures or dislocation.  \r\rThe ENs to Heading 9021 state, furthermore, that the orthopedic appliances referred to in the heading are appliances for  “preventing or correcting bodily deformities” or “supporting or holding organs following an illness or operation.” The ENs to Heading 9021 lists the type of orthopedic appliances that are included in that Heading as follows: \r\r1.  Appliances for hip diseases (coxalgia, etc.)\rHumerus splints (to enable use of an arm after resection), (extension splints).\r Appliances for the jaw. \r Traction, etc., appliances for the fingers.\r Appliances for treating Pott’s disease (straightening head and spine)\rOrthopaedic footwear, having enlarged leather stiffener, which may be reinforced with a metal or cork frame, made only to measure. \rSpecial insoles, made to measure.\rDental appliances for correcting deformities of the teeth (braces, rings, etc.) \rOrthopedic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> appliances (talipes appliances, leg braces, with or without spring support for the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, surgical boots, etc.).\r Trusses (inuinal, cural, umbilical, etc., trusses) and rupture appliances. \r Appliances for correcting scoliosis and curvature of the spine as well as all medical or surgical corsets and belts (including certain supporting belts) characterized by: \r\rSpecial pads, springs, etc., adjustable to fit the patient.\rThe materials of which they are made (leather, metal , plastic, etc.); or\rThe presence of reinforced parts, rigid pieces of fabric or bands of various widths. \r\rThe special design of these articles for a particular orthopedic purpose distinguishes them from ordinary corsets and belts, whether or not the latter also serve to support or hold.\r\r12.  Orthopedic suspenders (other than simple suspenders of knitted, netted or crocheted materials, etc.)   \r\rThe description of the knee brace and knee immobilizer at issue indicates they are not “ejusdem generis” or “of the same kind” of merchandise as orthopedic appliances listed in Heading 9021.  The merchandise at issue is not intended to be worn post-operation or to correct a bodily deformity but rather to be used to enhance performance during exercise or sports activities. The ENs state that the splints and other fracture appliances referenced in Heading 9021 may be used either to immobilize injured parts of the body or to set fractures.  While the ankle braces at issue may restrict movement, they do not immobilize the ankle as contemplated in the ENs to Heading 9021. [Emphasis added] See HQ 964317, dated May 1, 2001 (ruling that a knee brace made of 90 percent neoprene and 10 percent nylon or polyester and elastic with two hinged metal braces would be excluded from classification in Heading 9021 because it does not immobilize the knee); HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995, (ruling that a neoprene wrist support containing permanently inserted, rigid plastic support bars that were designed to immobilize the wrist in order to relieve tendinitis and prevent recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome were properly classifiable in 9021).  (Emphasis added) \r\rThese items which may be used to prevent sprains or strains and to support the area of the body where they are worn are not considered to be of the class or kind of appliance used to compensate for bodily deformities or to be used following illnesses or operations of an incapacitating nature.  See NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991 (hinged knee support and back support with plastic stiffeners excluded from Heading 9021).  The appliances included, in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, e.g., appliances for hip disease, for correcting scoliosis and trusses (used generally for treating hernias) are similar in the sense that they enable the wearer to engage in the activities of everyday life.  The knee brace and knee immobilizers are clearly not items that are generally worn in order to function in everyday life but rather to engage in sports activities.  We note that orthopaedic footwear and special insoles might also be used by the wearer to engage in athletic activities but the ENs provide that those items are made to measure and not marketed to a mass market as are the subject merchandise in the instant case. The fact that most, if not all, of the items referred to in the ENs to Heading 9021 must be fitted to a particular individual is also a feature which the items at issue do not share with the enumerated articles. \r\rAlthough the knee brace and knee immobilizer would not be excluded from Heading 9021 because they do not derive support solely from their elasticity, as discussed above, the items are nonetheless not esjudem generis with the exemplars in Heading 9021. \r\rHEADING 9506\r\rHaving precluded classification in Heading 9021, HTSUSA, we must determine whether classification in Heading 9506, HTSUSA is appropriate. Heading 9506, HTSUSA provides for, inter alia, articles and equipment for gymnastics, athletics, other sports and outdoor games\r\rThe ENs to Heading 9506 state in pertinent part: \r\rThis heading covers: \r\r* * *\r(B) Requisites for other sports and outdoor games (other than toys presented in sets, or separately of Heading 95.03), e.g.:\r\r* *\r(13) Protective equipment for sports or games, e.g., fencing masks and breast plates, elbow and knee pads, cricket pads, shin-guards.  \r\rThe sports protective equipment intended for inclusion within Heading 9506, HTSUSA, recognizes only that equipment which is designed exclusively for protection against injury, that is equipment having protective features with the sole or primary function of directly absorbing the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects.  See HQ 958791, dated May 13, 1996 (knee pads used for playing sports, elbow pads and wrist guards are classifiable in Heading 9506);  HQ 958387, dated April 8, 1996 (protective gear including knee and elbow pads used by in-line skaters to protect their knees, elbows and wrists against impact and abrasion are properly classifiable in Heading 9506);  HQ 957120, dated January 31, 1995  (ruling that wrist guards utilized for in line skating are classifiable under Heading 9506);  HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995 (ruling that  a hand/forearm pad, shin guards and elbow pad specifically designed to prevent injury while playing football or soccer are properly classifiable as protective sports equipment under Heading 9506); HQ 951406, dated July 13, 1992 (knee pads, elbow pads and wrist guards consisting of hard plastic cups and high impact plastic splint inserts, utilized for sporting activities have the primary function of protecting the wearer during sporting activities and are therefore properly classifiable in Heading 9506) [Emphasis added]; NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991 (a padded shin guard, specially designed to protect against leg blows in the game of soccer and an elbow support which primarily provides protection against blows or falls qualify for classification in Heading 9506 but a hinged knee support and a back support were excluded from Heading 9506 because neither of these items have as their sole or primary function to directly absorb the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects).  \r\rSignificantly, neither the knee brace nor the knee immobilizer at issue is described as either a “pad” or a “guard.”  Nor is the knee brace or knee immobilizer designed with the sole or primary function of directly absorbing the impact of blows, collisions or flying objects.  Accordingly, Heading 9506, HTSUSA does not apply to the knee brace or immobilizer as their function is not to protect from impact imposed by blows, collisions or flying objects.\r\rHaving eliminated the possibility of classification under Heading 9021, HTSUSA and Heading 9506, HTSUSA, we must now determine whether the subject merchandise is properly classifiable in either chapter 62 as body supporting articles or in chapter 63 as other made up articles.\r\rHEADING 6212\r\rHeading 6212 provides for inter alia, braces. The ENs to Heading 6212, HTSUSA, state in pertinent part:\r\rThe Heading covers articles of a kind designed for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> as body-supporting garments or as supports for certain other articles of apparel, and parts thereof…\r\rThe Heading includes, inter alia: \r\r(1) Brassieres of all kinds.\r(2) Girdles and panty-girdles.\r(3) Corselettes (combinations of girdles or panty-girdles and brassieres). \r(4) Corsets and corset belts.   These are usually reinforced with flexible metallic, whalebone or plastic stays, and are generally fastened by lacing or by hooks. \r(5) Suspender-belts, hygienic belts, supersensory bandages, suspender jock-straps braces, suspenders, garters, shirt-sleeve supporting arm-bands and armlets.\r(6) Body belts for men (including those combined with under pants)\r(7) Maternity, post-pregnancy or similar supporting corrective belts, not being orthopedic appliances of Heading 90.21.  \r\rThis office is of the opinion that the exemplars to Heading 6212 are united by the fact that they support apparel or other items (e.g. garters) or are garments (e.g. brassieres) and are generally worn underneath other garments as, for example, maternity belts or men’s body belts.  See HQ 952568, dated January 28, 1993; HQ 952390, dated December 16, 1992; HQ 952201, dated October 26, 1992.  The knee brace and knee immobilizer, unlike the exemplars in the ENs to Heading 6212, are not worn as a garment or an accessory to a garment and are therefore not properly classifiable in Heading 6212.  \r \rHEADING 6307\r\rHeading 6307, HTSUSA, is a residual provision which provides for other made up articles of textiles. Section Note 7 (e) of Section XI, which covers textiles and textile articles states in pertinent part as follows: \r\r7. For the purposes of this Section the expression “made up” means: \r\rAssembled by sewing…..\r\rThe instant articles have been assembled by sewing, therefore they constitute made up textile articles.  The Explanatory Notes state regarding Heading 6307:\r\rThis Heading covers made up articles of any textile material which are not included more specifically in the Heading of Section XI or elsewhere in the Nomenclature. \r\rSince the knee brace and knee immobilizer are not covered by any more specific heading, they are classifiable in Heading 6307, HTSUSA.\r\rThe ENs to 6307 specifically provide for articles such as the knee brace and knee immobilizer in Note (27) which notes that Heading 6307 includes, in particular: \r\rSupport articles of the kind referred to in Note 1 (b) to Chapter 90 for joints (e.g., knees, ankles, elbows or wrist) or muscles (e.g., thigh muscles), other than those falling in other Headings of Section XI. \r\t\r Customs has classified merchandise that is similar to the knee brace and knee immobilizer at issue, knee braces with hinged support bars, under Heading 6307. See 963534, dated August 29, 2001; HQ 964317, dated May 1, 2001; HQ 952568, dated January 28, 1993.  In addition, this ruling is consistent with several other rulings in which articles supporting joints or organs were classified in Heading 6307.  See HQ 958791, dated May 13, 1996 (revoking NY 840648 and classifying a knit elbow/knee support composed of 39 percent cotton and 61 percent man- made fibers with ten magnets sewn into the supporter in Heading 6307); HQ 958190, dated September 5, 1995 (ruling that adjustable neoprene knee supports which support the joint solely by means of their elasticity should remain classified in Heading 6307); HQ 952295, dated January 5, 1993 (ruling that a heel cup/anklet composed of neoprene and a soft flexible material such as molded rubber or thermoplastic was classifiable in Heading 6307); HQ 951844, dated September 4, 1992 (ruling that a pair of cotton/stretch nylon wristbands neither of which contained a protective insert or pad were classifiable in Heading 6307); HQ 952390, dated December 16, 1992 (ruling that a lumbar support belt with four or six covered metal vertical stays is classifiable in Heading 6307); NY E82026, dated June 16, 1999 (knee sleeve and wrist sleeve composed of neoprene rubber laminated on both sides with knit fabric classified in Heading 6307).\r\rWe note that in NY 862972, dated May 31, 1991, knee supports with hinges, were classified in Heading 6212, HTSUSA.   In HQ 087552, dated October 1, 1990 and HQ 086667, dated May 9, 1990, a knee stabilizer, and a knee support respectively both composed of neoprene rubber laminated on both the inner and outer surfaces with knit nylon fabric were classified in Heading 6212, HTSUSA.  Also in NY A89561, dated December 11, 1996, ankle braces made of a heavy reinforced textile material for the purpose of providing ankle support for football players were classified in Heading 9021, HTSUSA.  Appropriate steps are currently being taken to review these decisions and to modify and revoke those rulings as necessary. \r\rHOLDING: \r\rThe knee brace and knee immobilizer are properly classified in subheading 6307.90.9989, HTSUSA which provides for “Other made up articles, including dress patterns; Other; Other: Other: Other: Other.”  The \rgeneral column one rate of duty is 7 percent ad valorem.   There currently is no textile quota category applicable to this provision.  \r\rSincerely, \r\r\r\rJohn Durant, Director\rCommercial Rulings Division\r\r\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/2001/965237.doc"",""id"":18169,""rulingNumber"":""965237"",""subject"":""Modification of NY D88848, April 1, 1999; Classification of a knee brace and knee immobilizer"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""2001-12-05T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""D88848"",""964317"",""958190"",""862972"",""958791"",""958387"",""957120"",""951406"",""952568"",""952390"",""952201"",""963534"",""840648"",""952295"",""951844"",""E82026"",""087552"",""086667"",""A89561""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[""D88848""],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6307.90.9989""]}"

The articles consist of a 12” dressed doll and a matching textile costume for the child to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  Each set is packaged inside a closed window box.\r\r\tStock number 62160W (Pink Set) is comprised of a 12” stuffed doll and a textile costume for the child consisting of a textile apron, skirt, wings, pair of slippers and a hair scrunchie.  The doll has a vinyl head, arms and legs and a stuffed torso.  The apron for the child covers the entire torso area and is composed of a woven silver top with a non-woven, white, net skirt.  The apron has fabric ties around the neck and ribbon ties at the back of the waist.  The neck of the apron has been turned and hemmed and two fabric bows have been sewn on at either corner across the top.  The woven sides of the apron are also turned and hemmed.  The bottom edges of the net skirt have a jagged unfinished cut.  The pink skirt is made up of two layers of material with a jagged, unfinished, edge at the bottom.  The skirt layers are gathered at the waist, with a 2 ½” wide band of raw cut fabric, that is sewn via single stitching to a very thin elastic.  The wings are made of pink textile material with a fabric backing and internal fabric stiffener.  Its edges are completely finished with textile piping.  A plastic reinforcement strip is sewn horizontally across the wing span to maintain its shape.  Two elasticized loops are attached at the center of the wings for securing around the shoulders.  The silver, ballet style, slippers are made of textile material and have a fabric bow attached above the toe area.  The hair scrunchie is constructed of a silver textile fabric sewn onto an elastic band.  The item features a stuffed representation of a star that is sewn onto the scrunchie.\r\rThe second sample, stock number 62160WAF (White and Gold Set), consists of a 12” stuffed doll and a textile costume for the child consisting of a dress, slippers and a fabric crown.  The doll has a vinyl head, arms and legs and a stuffed torso.  The dress is constructed with puff sleeves, a gathering at the waist (which includes a thin elastic at the sides) and a large gold bow sewn to the front center of the waist.  The dress is turned and hemmed at the neck (front and back), arms, and bottom.  It closes down the back with hook and loop fastener tabs.  The bottom of the dress also features small gatherings held up by tacking with tiny gold bows.  The white, ballet style, slippers are made of textile material and have a gold fabric bow attached above the toe area.  A woven fabric crown is designed to sit on the head and secures via an elastic band with hook and loop fastener tabs.\r\rThe classification of merchandise under the HTS is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI'S).  GRI 1 of the HTS, states in part that \""for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes . . . ”\r\rThe Explanatory Notes, which represent the official interpretation of the HTS at the international level, for GRI 3(b) define \""goods put up in sets for retail sale.\""  Such goods: (a) consist of at least two different articles that are classifiable in different headings, (b) consist of products put up together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity, and (c) are put up in a manner suitable for sale directly to users without repacking.\r\rThe components of the \""Doll Dress up Sets\"" do not constitute a set for classification purposes.  Although the outfits for the child match the dress on the doll and they are packaged together, the collections of articles are not related to a common activity, nor are they put up together to meet a particular need.  Playing with a doll and dressing up to resemble one’s doll are two separate and distinct activities.  Having failed as a set, each item in the retail package must be separately classified.\r\r\tHeading 9505, HTSUSA includes articles that are for “Festive, carnival, or other entertainment.”  It must be noted, however, that Note 1(e), to chapter 95, HTSUSA, does not cover “fancy dress, of textiles, of chapter 61 or 62.”  The EN’s to 9505, state that the heading covers:\r\rFestive, carnival or other entertainment articles, which in view of their intended use\rare generally made of non-durable material.  They include:\r\t\t\t\t\r(3) Articles of fancy dress, e.g., masks, false ears and noses, wigs, false beards\rand moustaches (not being articles of pastiche- heading 67.04), and paper hats.  However, the heading excludes fancy dress of textile materials, of chapter 61\ror 62.\r\r\tTherefore, Customs must determine, depending upon the construction of the garments, whether the \""fancy dress\"" is of flimsy construction of 9505.90 or, if it is well made, is classifiable within Chapters 61 or 62.  This can be accomplished by separately identifying characteristics in each article that would indicate whether or not it is of a flimsy nature and construction, lacking in durability, and generally recognized as a normal article of apparel.\r \rIn the case of stock number 62160W, the apron and skirt for the child are made of non-durable construction with most edges being unfinished, having a narrow elastic band at the waist and little, if any, styling.  The wings, however, are well made and viewed as an apparel accessory of Chapter 61.\r\rItem number 62160WAF, features a gold dress that contains styling features and is well made with finished edges all around.  The dress, for classification purposes, is considered wearing apparel of Chapter 61.  Another article in this set, the textile crown, also of good construction, is viewed as an apparel accessory of Chapter 61.  Although it sits on top of the head, the crown does not serve to hold the hair in place.\r\rThe footwear in each set is of substantial construction and is more specifically provided for under the heading “footwear” classified in HTS chapter 64.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the 12” stuffed doll in item numbers 62160W (Pink Set) and 62160WAF (White and Gold Set), will be 9502.10.0010, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for dolls representing only human beings and parts and accessories thereof: whether or not dressed: stuffed.  The rate of duty will be free.\r\rThe applicable subheading for the silver scrunchie of #62160W (Pink Set), will be 6117.80.8500, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for “Other made up clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted; knitted or crocheted parts of garments or of clothing accessories: Other accessories: Other: Headbands, ponytail holders and similar articles.”  The rate of duty will be 15% ad valorem.\r\rThe issue of the classification of garments under heading 9505 is currently pending before the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) in the matter of Rubie’s Costume Company, Inc. v. United States, Court No. 99-0600388.  Section 177.7, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.7) provides that rulings will not be issued in certain circumstances.  Section 177.7(b) states, in pertinent part, the following:\r\rNo ruling letter will be issued with respect to any issue, which is pending \rbefore the United States Court of International Trade, the United States \rCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom.\r\rWith respect to the apron and skirt of item number 62160W (Pink Set), and in light of the prohibition set out in 19 CFR 177.7(b), we are unable to issue a classification ruling for these products because they are closely related to the issue presently pending before the CIT.  You may submit another request for classification of these articles after the court has issued its decision in the Rubie’s Costume Company case.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the gold dress in item number 62160WAF, will be 6104.43.2020, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for “Women’s or girls’ suits, ensembles, suit-type jackets, blazers, dresses, skirts, divided skirts, trousers. Bib and brace overalls, breeches and shots (other than swimwear), knitted or crocheted: Dresses: Of synthetic fibers: Other, Girls’.”  The duty rate will be 16.4 percent ad valorem.  The textile category designation is 636.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the pink wings of item 62160W and the textile crown in item number 62160WAF will be 6117.80.9540, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for “Other made up clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted; knitted or crocheted parts of garments of clothing accessories: Other accessories: Other: Other, Of man-made fibers: Other.”  The duty rate will be 15% ad valorem.  The textile category designation is 659.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the footwear in both item numbers 62160W (Pink Set) and 62160WAF (White and Gold Set), will be 6404.19.35, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear of the slip-on type that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, with outer soles of rubber or plastics and uppers of textile material, which does not have a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper, which is not designed to be worn over, or in lieu of, other footwear as a protection against water, oil, grease or chemicals or cold or inclement weather, footwear which is more than 10% by weight of rubber or plastics.  The rate of duty will be 37.5% ad valorem.\r\rBased upon international textile trade agreements products of China are subject to quota and the requirement of a visa.\r\rThe designated textile and apparel categories and their quota and visa status are the result of international agreements that are subject to frequent renegotiations and changes.  To obtain the most current information, we suggest that you check, close to the time of shipment, the U.S. Customs Service Textile Status Report, an internal issuance of the U.S. Customs Service, which is available at the Customs Web site at www.customs.gov.  In addition, the designated textile and apparel categories may be subdivided into parts.  If so, visa and quota requirements applicable to the subject merchandise may be affected and should also be verified at the time of shipment.\r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

"{""text"":""\r\rHQ H076736\r\rFebruary 1, 2010\r\rCLA-2: OT:RR:CTF:TCM H076736 TNA\u000B\rCATEGORY: Classification\u000B\rTARIFF NO.: 6405.20.9060\r\rMs. Susan Kohn Ross, Esq.\rMitchell, Silberberg & Knupp, LLP\r11377 West Olympic Boulevard\rLos Angeles, CA  90064-1683\r\rRE: Reconsideration of NY N062498; Classification of the Slipper Genie\r\rDear Ms. Ross:\r\r\tThis letter is in response to your request dated September 11, 2009, on behalf of your client, Evriholder Products, LLC (“Evriholder”), for reconsideration of New York Ruling Letter (“NY”) N062498, dated June 2, 2009, which classified the Slipper Genie under subheading 6405.20.9060, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”), as “Other footwear: With uppers of textile materials: Other, Other: For women.”  We have reviewed NY N062498 and found it to be correct.  For the reasons set forth below, we hereby affirm NY N062498.\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe merchandise at issue is the “Slipper Genie.” It comes in the shape of a slipper.  Its uppers are made primarily of textile and contain a vamp made of foam-backed cotton attached to the bottom part of the upper with binding tape.  This bottom part is made of foam-backed cotton and a thin rigid polyethylene insert and contains the hook side of a hook-and-loop Velcro fastener.  The slipper’s outer sole contains the loop side of the Velcro fastener sewn to a microfiber chenille duster.  The sole’s length, width, and shape correspond exactly to the bottom of the slipper’s upper. \r\rIn NY N062498, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) classified the Slipper Genie under subheading 6405.20.9060, HTSUS, “Other footwear: With uppers of textile material: Other, Other: For women.”\r\r\r\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhether the Slipper Genie should be classified under heading 6307, HTSUS, as an “Other made up article,” or under heading 6405, HTSUS, as “Other footwear”.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUS is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then be applied. \r\rGRI 3(b) states that:\rWhen, by application of Rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows:\r…\rMixtures, composite goods consisting or different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.\r\t\rNote 1 to Chapter 64, HTSUS, states, in pertinent part:\r\rThis chapter does not cover:…\r\r(b) Footwear of textile material, without an outer sole glued, sewn or otherwise affixed or applied to the upper (section XI);\r\rThe headings at issue are as follows:\t\r\r6307\tOther made up articles, including dress patterns\t \r\r6405\t\tOther footwear\r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN’s) constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System. While not legally binding on the contracting parties, and therefore not dispositive, the EN’s provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the Harmonized System and are thus useful in ascertaining the classification of merchandise under the system. CBP believes the EN’s should always be consulted.  See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (Aug. 23, 1989).\r\rEN IX to GRI 3(b) states that:\rFor the purposes of this Rule, composite goods made up of different components shall be taken to mean not only those in which the components are attached to each other to form a practically inseparable whole, but also those with separable components, provided these components are adapted one to the other and are mutually complementary, and that together they form a whole which would not normally be offered for sale in separate parts… As a general rule, the components of these composite goods are put up in a common packing.\r\rEN VIII to GRI 3(b) provides:\r\rThe factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods. It may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of a constituent material in relation to the use of the goods.\r\rThe EN to heading 6307, HTSUS, states, in pertinent part, that:\rThis heading covers made up articles of any textile material which are not included more specifically in other headings of Section XI or elsewhere in the Nomenclature.\rIt includes, in particular:\r(1)\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Floor-cloths, dish-cloths, dusting cloths and similar cleaning cloths (whether or not impregnated with a cleaning preparation, but excluding those of heading 34.01 or 34.05).\r\r\tThe EN to heading 6405, HTSUS, states, in pertinent part, that: \r\rSubject to Notes 1 and 4 to this Chapter, this heading covers all footwear having outer soles and uppers of a material or combination of materials not referred to in the preceding headings of this Chapter.\r\u00A0\rThe heading includes in particular:…\r(3)\u00A0\u00A0 Footwear with outer soles of wood, cork, twine or rope, paperboard, furskin, textile fabric, felt, nonwovens, linoleum, raffia, straw, loofah, etc. The uppers of such footwear may be of any material.\r\rIn the present case, the Slipper Genie consists of two parts: an upper made primarily of textile, and a sole made of a microfiber chenille duster.  As a result, it consists of different components that are prima facie classifiable in different headings, and is therefore classifiable under GRI 3(b).  Although the two parts of the Slipper Genie can be separated from each other, they are designed \r\r\rto fit one another.  Their dimensions and shape correspond to each other and each contains one half of the hook-and-loop fastener.  The two parts are sold together as one unit and are imported as such.  As a result, the Slipper Genie is a composite good within the meaning of GRI 3(b).\r\rIn addition to the guidance provided by EN VIII to GRI 3(b), there have also been several court decisions on “essential character” for purposes of GRI 3(b). These cases have looked to the role of the constituent materials or components in relation to the use of the goods to determine essential character. Structural Industries v. United States, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1330, 1337-1338 (CIT 2005); Conair Corp. v. United States, 29 C.I.T. 888 (2005); Home Depot USA, Inc. v. United States, 427 F. Supp. 2d 1278, 1295-1356 (CIT 2006), aff’d 491 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\r\rIn the present case, Evriholder argues that the slipper’s chenille duster sole imparts the good’s essential character because the Slipper Genie is a cleaning tool rather than footwear.  The company argues that the sole’s chenille microfiber is a popular cleaning material, and that the upper is simply a convenient way of using the sole.  Furthermore, the company states, the Slipper Genie can be used just as well for cleaning if the upper is removed, and could be used for that purpose even if worn on the hand.\r\rUpon examination of the submitted samples, however, we find that the uppers are sturdy enough to withstand repeated use as footwear, and are designed to withstand such use.  The attachment of the chenille microfiber sole to an upper, so that a cleaning product can be used as footwear, is the Slipper Genie’s innovation.  Given the number of cleaning products that are designed for hand-held use, it is unlikely that a consumer would purchase the Slipper Genie and use it as a hand-held product.  Furthermore, the subject merchandise is named the “Slipper Genie,” thereby putting emphasis on the product’s character as footwear.  We have reviewed Evriholder’s website and other websites that sell the subject merchandise.  On each site, the ability to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> the Slipper Genie on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> was the product’s dominant feature.\r\rFurthermore, we find HQ W98135, dated October 3, 2006, to be applicable.  There, we classified Bright Feet Lighted Slippers, which were slippers containing lights activated when the slippers were worn in darkness, according to their footwear component.  We do not find Evriholder’s attempt to distinguish this opinion persuasive.  As a result, we find that the Slipper Genie’s footwear component imparts the good’s essential character.\r\r\r\r\r\rWe find that Note 1 to Chapter 64, HTSUS, does not exclude the subject merchandise from that chapter because the outer sole is “otherwise affixed” to the upper by means of the hook and loop fasteners.  Therefore, the Slipper Genie is classified in heading 6405, HTSUS, and specifically in subheading 6405.20.9060, as “Other footwear: With uppers of textile materials: Other, Other: For women.”\r\rHOLDING: \r\rUnder the authority of GRI 3(b), the Slipper Genie is provided for in heading 6405, HTSUS. Specifically, it is classified in subheading 6405.20.9060, HTSUS, which provides for “Other footwear: With uppers of textile materials: Other, Other: For women.” As such, the duty rate is 12.5% ad valorem.\r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.

After review of that ruling, Customs has determined that the classification for one of the three styles considered has changed from subheading 6115.93.9020, HTSUSA, as other stockings to subheading 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA, as surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.

L. 103-82, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186), notice of the proposed modification of NY E82593 was published on January 8, 2003, in the Customs Bulletin, Volume 37, Number 2.  As explained in the notice, the period within which to submit comments on this proposal was until February 7, 2003.  No comments were received in response to this notice.\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe article under consideration is one style of compression hosiery, identified in NY E82593 as Style Soft 141 (style 141).  Style 141 is comprised of 63 percent polyamide and 38 percent elastane fabric, with a decitex of 486.  Style 141 supplies graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg1 and is prescribed by a physician.  \r\rIn NY E82593, Customs classified style 141 in subheading 6115.93.9020, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Of synthetic fibers: Other: Other, Other.\""  We note that at the time NY E82593 was issued we considered the following:  \r\rIt is Customs position that surgical compression hosiery, because of their construction and application of use, are more than simple compression stockings to treat varicose veins.  The hosiery is made of heavy gauge, opaque, elasticized knit fabric, and is designed to supply compression in the range of 30-40 mm mercury to 50-60 mercury.  They are prescribed by physicians for the treatment of venous diseases and other serious conditions such as reversible and irreversible lymphedema and severe post-thrombotic treatment.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper classification of the subject graduated compression hosiery under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.  Merchandise that cannot be classified in accordance with GRI 1 is to be classified in accordance with subsequent GRI taken in order.  The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN), constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the EN provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUSA and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.\r\rHeading 6115, HTSUSA, provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted.\""  \r\r\tIn HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, both dated January 2, 2002, Customs classified stockings with graduated compression ranging 20-30 mm Hg as surgical stockings for orthopedic treatment.  To reach our decision, we considered a study evaluating the effects of duration of use of class I (20-30 mm Hg) graduated compression hosiery.  See Robert Weiss, Neil Sadick, Mitchel Goldman, & Margaret Weiss, Post-Sclerotherapy Compression: Controlled Comparative Study of Duration of Compression and its Effects on Clinical Outcome DERMATOL SURG, 35: 105-108 (1999).  This study essentially persuaded our office that compression greater than 20 mm Hg is presently considered necessary for reduction of venous insufficiency.2 We noted certain statements made in the study, including \"" . . . in terms of controlling objective and subjective parameters of venous insufficiency no difference was found between class I (20-30 mm Hg) and class II (30-40 mm Hg) compression stockings.\""  Based on our review, we found that the study suggested that sclerotherapy results overall can be significantly improved by class I compression and should be part of the post-operative sclerotherapy protocol.  In citing other studies, the study concluded that class I (20-30 mm Hg) compression may be recommended over class II since patient compliance is much higher and symptom improvement is identical.  See Jungbeck C, Thulin I, Darenheim C, Norgen L.  Graduated Compression Treatment in Patients with Chronic Venous Insufficiency; A Study Comparing Low and Medium Grade Compression Stockings.  PHLEBOLOGIE, 12:142-5 (1997). \r\rMoreover, during our review of HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, this office examined several letters from vascular surgeons and dermatologists familiar with the beneficial effects of compression on the venous system.  The letters indicated consensus within the medical community that surgical stockings with graduated compression of 20-30 mm Hg are principally used for orthopedic purposes and are primarily prescribed by physicians to prevent or correct bodily deformities and the consequences associated with venous disease.  The letters established that it is widely recognized that 20 mm Hg of compression is considered necessary for the treatment of venous disease.  We noted in HQ 963517 and HQ 963518 that the physicians stated that they recommend using surgical supports with graduated compression of 20 to 30 mm Hg for several reasons: to prevent telangiectatic matting following sclerotherapy, to prevent thrombus formation and phlebitic reactions following sclerotherapy, to reduce post-operative edema, to prevent venous ulcerations, to prevent venous dermatitis and as treatment protocol for post-operative invasive vascular procedures.  \r\rIn HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, Customs determined that physicians generally recommend graduated compression therapy as a treatment for venous insufficiency.  We further recognized that graduated compression hosiery is generally available in three classes of compression; class I specifically covers a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg.  We found that physicians generally prescribe compression stockings and that doctors indicated that patients generally find the hosiery uncomfortable and do not <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them unless directed by a doctor.  Moreover, letters from medical authorities and conversations with medical professionals confirmed that certified and well-trained personnel must measure various parts of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and leg of a patient in order to obtain a proper fit for the stockings.  We also found that pharmacies and medical supply companies prefer that a patient have a prescription that prescribes the amount of compression and noted that stockings obtained by prescription are often covered by insurance.  We observed that graduated compression stockings are significantly more expensive than support hosiery of the types generally found in retail stores, noting that panty hose with 20-30 mm Hg compression typically sell for approximately $75.00 to $100.00 and similar thigh-high stockings typically sell for $60.00 to $95.00 per pair.\r\rAccordingly, in HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, we concluded that surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg should be considered surgical hosiery with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment when prescribed by a physician and/or specially fitted to the patient.  \r\rAs the subject merchandise has a graduated compression range of 20-30 mm Hg and is prescribed by a physician, Customs finds the instant graduated compression hosiery is within the scope of subheading 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA, providing for surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\r\rHOLDING:\r\rBased on the foregoing, style 141 is classified under subheading 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Other: Of synthetic fibers: Surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\"" The general column one rate of duty is \""Free.\"" \r\rNY E82593 is hereby MODIFIED, in part.  In accordance with 19 U.S.C. §1625(c), this ruling will become effective 60 days after its publication in the Customs Bulletin.\rSincerely,\r\r\r\rMyles B. Harmon, Director\rCommercial Rulings Division\r1 Compression is measured by how much pressure is required to elevate a column of Mercury (Hg) a certain distance, as measured in millimeters (mm).\r2  The partial failure of leg veins to carry blood up towards the heart results in venous disorders, which vary in severity from mild varicosity to deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.  The use of graduated compression stockings is one of the methods used in the prevention and treatment of these disorders.  The stockings are constructed so that the maximum pressure is exerted at the ankle and gradually decreasing up the leg, thus achieving a milking effect that helps blood rise toward the heart.  \r5\r\r\r\r2\r\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/2003/965918.doc"",""id"":20309,""rulingNumber"":""965918"",""subject"":""Modification of New York Ruling Letter E82593, dated June 11, 1999; Classification of Medical Graduated Compression Stockings"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""2003-02-12T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""E82593"",""963517"",""963518""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[""E82593""],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6115.93.3000""]}"
"{""text"":""\r\r\r\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\rHQ 965137\r\rSeptember 12, 2002\r\r\rCLA-2:  RR:CR:TE   965137   ASM\r\rCATEGORY:  Classification\r\rTARIFF NO.: 6102.30.2010 \r\rArea Director\rU.S. Customs Service\rJFK International Airport\rBuilding 77 \rJamaica, NY   11430\r\rRE:\tDecision on Application for Further Review of Protest No. 1001-01-101276, Concerning the classification of Women’s Knitted Wearing Apparel\r\rDear Port Director:\r\r\tThis is a decision on a protest timely filed on behalf of Knight Textile Corporation on March 29, 2001, against your classification decision.  A sample was submitted on July 2, 2002, and has been reviewed by this office.\r\rFACTS:\r\r\tThe sample is identified by the importer as a Ladies’ 100 percent polyester knit “polar fleece” jacket (style # K2W73266).  The sample is a long sleeved black knit garment that has been constructed of fabric with a weight that exceeds ten ounces per square yard.  The garment has pockets at the waist, a heavy duty zipper, elasticized cuffs, and a 3 inch stand-up collar formed of two layers of polar fleece material that zips directly under the chin.  There is also a heavy duty zipper pocket at the upper left front panel and reinforcing bias tape to which each front zipper edge has been attached.  Each zipper <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> (front and breast pocket) has a pull tab.  The lower edge of the jacket has a turned hem secured by a double seam zig-zag stitch.    \r\r- 2 -\r\r\tOn December 29, 2000, Customs classified the subject garment and liquidated the entry as an “other” cardigan sweater under subheading 6110.30.3055, HTSUSA, with a textile quota category designation of 639.  The importer timely protested liquidation of this entry with respect to the garments identified as style # K2W73266, and has asserted the correct classification to be a women’s jacket in subheading 6102.30.2010, HTSUSA, quota category 635. \r\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhat is the proper classification for the merchandise?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be  classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the heading and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI may then be applied. The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (“ENs”) constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.  See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rIn determining whether the subject article is classifiable as an outerwear jacket within the meaning of heading 6102, HTSUSA, or as a cardigan sweater under heading 6110, HTSUSA, we begin by noting that it has features that are typical of both a cardigan and an outerwear garment. In such situations, it is appropriate to consult the Guidelines for the Reporting of Imported Products in Various Textile and Apparel Categories, C.I.E. 13/88, November 23, 1988 (Textile Guidelines). The Textile Guidelines set forth eleven criteria by which to classify a garment as a jacket under the HTSUSA. If the garments possess at least three of the eleven features, and if the result is not unreasonable, the articles will be classified as a coat/jacket.  In relevant part, the guidelines state as follows:\r\rFabric weight equal to or exceeding 10 ounces per square yard.\rA full or partial lining.\r\r- 3 -\r\rPockets at or below the waist.\rBack vents or pleats.  Also side vents in combination with back seams.\rEisenhower styling.\rA belt or simulated belt or elasticized waist on hip length or longer shirt-jackets.\rLarge jacket/coat style buttons, toggles or snaps, a heavy-duty zipper or other heavy-duty closure, or buttons fastened with reinforcing thread for heavy-duty use.\rLapels.\rLong sleeves without cuffs.\rElasticized or rib-knit cuffs.\rDrawstring, elastic or rib-knit waistband.\r\t \rIn the subject case, the garment possesses at least three of the eleven jacket features enumerated in the Textile Guidelines as follows:  1) pockets at or below the waist; 2) a heavy duty zipper; 3) elasticized cuffs.  In addition, the subject garment is comprised of a fabric that is napped on the inside surface for additional warmth. Thus, when one considers in totality, all of these features combined, the subject garment conveys a strong overall appearance of being for use as a jacket to provide the outermost layer of warmth and protection against the elements.  Thus, we believe that classification as a “jacket” under heading 6102, HTSUSA, would not be unreasonable in this case.  \r\r\tFinally, we note that the recently published Apparel Terminology under the HTSUS provides a definition for “Anoraks, windbreakers and similar articles” which states that the group includes:\r\r\t\tJackets, which are garments designed to be worn over another \rgarment, for protection against the elements… Knit jackets \r(due to the particular character of knit fabric) generally have\rtightening elements at the cuffs and at the waist or bottom \rof the garment, although … garments made of heavier\rmaterial might not need these tightening elements.\r(Emphasis supplied)\r\rThe subject article falls within this “jacket” definition because it has been designed to be worn over another garment(s) for protection against the elements.  While it lacks a tightening element at the bottom, it has been constructed of a thick knit fabric that will provide substantial warmth to the wearer as a final layer of outerwear.\r \r\r- 4 -\r\rAlthough Customs has previously ruled that certain knit garments that resemble jackets are properly classifiable as “sweaters”, “pullovers”, and “other garments” under Chapter 61, HTSUSA, these rulings did not involve the classification of a knit garment, such as the one at issue, which combine all the following outerwear features: a heavy duty full frontal zipper, two pockets at the waist, elasticized cuffs, 3 inch stand-up collar comprised of two layers of fabric, and a napped interior for added warmth.  See HQ 956795, dated January 25, 1995; HQ 950045, dated December 3, 1991; HQ 951629, dated August 21, 1992; HQ 954827, dated December 8, 1993. \r\rSpecifically, HQ 956795 (supra) determined that a man’s long sleeved upper body garment constructed of 100 percent knit polyester, heavily napped on both the inside and outside surfaces would otherwise have been classifiable as a jacket under subheading 6101.30.2010, HTSUSA, if it had been designed with a full frontal zipper opening.  To support this statement, the ruling cited to HQ 088289, dated February 11, 1991, in which Customs distinguished between sweatshirts classifiable under heading 6110, HTSUSA, and sweatshirts with full frontal zippers held classifiable as jackets of heading 6101, HTSUSA.  In classifying a long sleeve sweatshirt jacket with a full front zipper opening as a jacket of heading 6101, HTSUSA, HQ 088289, stated that “Garments with full-front zipper openings are not considered similar to sweatshirts, but are jackets.”\r\rHQ 962593, dated December 2, 1999, concluded that a garment constructed from fabric napped only on the inside, with full front zippered opening, long sleeves with rib knit cuffs, hood, pockets below the waist, and a straight hemmed bottom was classifiable as a cardigan in heading 6110, HTSUSA.  However, this ruling stated that, although the garment possessed three “jacket features”, it was not designed as a “jacket” for use over other outer <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  The ruling further stated:\r\r\t\tSpecifically, although we recognize that fabric weight is \rnot an absolute indicator of a garment’s status for classification\rpurposes, it does provide some indication as to a garment’s suitability for different uses.  In this case, the lightweight fabric construction of the subject garment would not likely provide\r\r- 5 -\r\rsufficient protection from the elements to the wearer when worn outside on cold days.  Additionally, features such as pockets at the waist and a hood, are not substantive proof that a garment is designed for use as outerwear.\r\r\tThe item now in question is distinguishable from the article classified in HQ 962593.  In that ruling, the knit garment did not feature a 3 inch stand-up collar constructed of two layers of polar fleece material for added warmth and two heavy-duty zippers with pull-tabs.  With these additional features, the subject article is clearly designed to provide the wearer protection against the elements and to be worn as a final layer over other garments.  Nor could the subject garment be described as constructed of “lightweight” fabric.  This garment offers the wearer substantial protection against the elements and has been principally designed for outdoor use.   \r\rIn view of the foregoing, it is our determination that the subject garment is properly classified as a knit jacket under heading 6102, HTSUSA.  Customs decision in the current ruling is consistent with our holding in HQ 963439, dated June 25, 2001, in which a boy’s long sleeve polar fleece knit garment of 100 percent polyester and no tightening at the waist was classified as a boy’s\rjacket under subheading 6101.30.2020, HTSUSA.  Accordingly, it is our determination that at the time of liquidation of this merchandise, Customs incorrectly classified the garment as a knit sweater under subheading 6110.30.3055, HTSUSA.\r\rHOLDING:\r\rThe subject merchandise, identified as Style #K2W73266, is correctly classified in subheading 6102.30.2010, HTSUSA, which provides for, “Women’s or girls’ overcoats, carcoats, capes, cloaks, anoraks (including ski-jackets), windbreakers and similar articles, knitted or crocheted, other than those of heading 6104:  Of man-made fibers:  Other:  Other, Women’s.”  The general column one duty rate is 28.6 percent ad valorem.  The textile category is 635.\r\rThe protest should be ALLOWED.  In accordance with Section 3A(11)(b) of Customs Directive 099 3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject:  Revised Protest Directive, you are to mail this decision, together with the Customs Form 19, to the Protestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter.  Any reliquidation of the entry or entries in accordance with the decision must be accomplished prior to mailing of the decision.\r\r- 6 -\r\r\tSixty days from the date of the decision, the Office of Regulations and Rulings will make the decision available to Customs personnel, and to the public on the Customs Home Page on the World Wide Web at www.customs.gov, by means of the Freedom of Information Act, and by other methods of public distribution.\r\rThe designated textile and apparel category may be subdivided into parts.  If so, the visa and quota requirements applicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since part categories are the result of international bilateral agreements which are subject to frequent renegotiations and changes, to obtain the most current information available, we suggest that the importer, by copy of this letter, be advised to check, close to the time of shipment, the Status Report on Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an internal issuance of the U.S. Customs Service, which is updated weekly and is available for inspection at your local Customs office.  The Status Report on Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels) is also available on the Customs Electronic Bulletin Board (CEEB) which can be found on the U.S. Customs Service Website at www.customs.gov.\r\rDue to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation (the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the restraint (quota/visa) categories applicable to textile merchandise, the importer should contact the local Customs office prior to importation of this merchandise to determine the current status of any import restraints or requirements.\r\r\r\r\t\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSincerely,\r\r\r\r\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMyles B.

A sample was submitted for our\rconsideration.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The merchandise at issue consists of woven cotton\rhospital patient gowns, with short sleeves and two rear\rties, which are imported from Pakistan.  New York Ruling PD\rA82009, dated April 22, 1996, held that the merchandise is\rclassifiable under subheading 6211.42.0081, Harmonized\rTariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides\rfor \""track suits, ski-suits and swimwear; other garments: \rother garments, women's or girls':  of cotton:  other.\""  New\rYork Supplemental decision 1, PD A82009, dated May 9, 1996,\rheld that the articles did not qualify for duty-free\rtreatment under subheading 9817.00.96, HTSUS, as \""articles\rspecially designed or adapted for the use or benefit of the\rblind or other physically or mentally handicapped persons.\"" \r\r     You indicate that Eastern Imports Limited does not sell\rthe imported articles to hospitals and nursing homes, but\rimports the articles for Medline Industries and Harbor\rLinen, both of which distribute the subject patient gowns,\ras well as sheets, towels, barmops, and bibs, to hospitals\rand nursing homes.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Whether the submitted cotton patient gowns are\r\""specially designed or adapted\"" for the handicapped within\rthe meaning of the Nairobi Protocol, Annex E, to the\rFlorence Agreement, as codified in the Education,\rScientific, and Cultural Materials Act of 1982, and\rtherefore eligible for duty-free treatment under subheading\r9817.00.96.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:   \r\r     The Nairobi Protocol, Annex E, to the Florence\rAgreement, as codified by the United States Congress  as the\rEducation, Scientific, and Cultural Materials Act of 1982\r(Pub.L. 97-446, 96 Stat. 2346(1982)) established the duty-free treatment for certain articles for the handicapped. \rPresidential Proclamation 5978 and Section 1121 of the\rOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, provided for\rthe implementation of the Nairobi Protocol into subheadings \r9817.00.92, 9817.00.94 and 9817.00.96 of the Harmonized\rTariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).  These tariff\rprovisions specifically state that \""[a]rticles specially\rdesigned or adapted for the use or benefit of the blind or\rother physically or mentally handicapped persons\"" are\religible for duty-free treatment.\r\r     However, U.S. Note 4(b), subchapter XVII, Chapter 98,\rHTSUS, establishes certain limitations on the classification\rof products in these subheadings, stating:\r\r          (B) Subheadings 9817.00.92, 9817.00.94\r          and 9817.00.96 do not cover --\r\r               (i)  articles for acute or transient\rdisability;\r\r               (ii) spectacles, dentures, and cosmetic\rarticles for individuals not                 substantially\rdisabled;\r\r               (iii)     therapeutic and diagnostic articles;\ror\r\r               (iv) medicine or drugs.\r\r     U.S. Note 4(a), subchapter XVII, Chapter 98, HTSUS,\rstates that \""the term  blind or other physically or mentally\rhandicapped persons' includes any person suffering from a\rpermanent or chronic physical or mental impairment which\rsubstantially limits one or more major life activities, such\ras caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking,\rseeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, or working.\""\r\r     Although the legislative history of the Nairobi\rProtocol discusses the concerns of Congress that the design,\rmodification or adaption of an article must be significant,\rso as to clearly render the article for use by handicapped\rindividuals, no specific definition of these terms was\restablished by Congress.  See Senate Report (Finance\rCommittee) No. 97-564, September 21, 1982.  See also HQ\r951004, dated March 3, 1992.  Because it is difficult to\restablish a clear definition of what is \""specially designed\ror adapted,\"" various factors must be utilized on a case-\rby-case basis to determine whether a given article is\r\""specially designed or adapted\"" within the meaning of this\rstatute.\r\r     In Treasury Decision 92-77 (Customs Bulletin, Vol. 26\r(1992)), Customs addressed the implementation of the duty-free provisions of the Nairobi Protocol, and discussed the\religibility requirements for duty-free treatment.  With\rregard to whether an article has been \""specially designed or\radapted\"" for the handicapped, Customs stated the following:\r\r          A primary factor to be considered\r          concerns the physical properties of the\r          article itself, i.e., whether the article\r          is easily distinguishable, by properties\r          of the design and the corresponding use\r          specific to this unique design from\r          articles useful to non-handicapped\r          individuals.  If an article is solely\r          dedicated for use by the handicapped,\r          e.g. pacemakers or hearing aids, then\r          this is conclusive evidence that the\r          articles are \""specially designed or\r          adapted\"" for the handicapped for purposes\r          of the Nairobi Protocol.\r\rYou contend that the following features of the patient gowns\runder consideration are indicative of such design features.\r\r     1) The garment utilizes two rear tie closures\r     instead of snaps or buttons that may be difficult\r     or impossible for patients to use.\r\r     2) The loose fit of the garment makes it possible\r     for the garment to be changed without disturbing\r     the patient or requiring him or her to stand.\r\r     3) The length of the gown is designed to ease the\r     use of bedpans and other hospital equipment. \r\rWhile these design features are of great utility to\rhandicapped individuals, the garment is not dedicated solely\rfor use by the handicapped.  Thus, the \""specific design\""\rfactors must be considered in conjunction with other\rrelevant factors which are discussed below.\r\r     The utility of the article to a non-handicapped person,\ri.e, the \""probability of general public use\"" is another\rrelevant factor set forth by T.D. 92-77.  In this regard,\ryou reference Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL) 556449, dated\rMay 5, 1992, stating \""[t]he determination was that the\rlikelihood of the general public utilizing bedside toilet or\rdressing articles is remote\"" and that like those articles,\r\""the patient gowns also have little chance of being used by\rthe general public.\""\r\r     In HRL 556449, supra,  Customs articulated the\rprinciple of \""probability of general public use\"" in\rdetermining whether an article is  \""specially designed or\radapted\"" within the meaning of the Nairobi Protocol.  The\rfollowing factors were considered to be relevant in making\rthis determination: 1) whether any characteristics are\rpresent that create a substantial probability of use by the\rchronically handicapped;  2) whether the article is easily\rdistinguishable from articles useful to the general public;\r3) whether use of the article by the general public is so\rimprobable that such use would be fugitive; 4) whether use\rof the articles by the general public would be inconvenient;\r5) whether articles are imported by manufacturers or\rdistributors recognized or proven to be involved in this\rclass or kind of articles for the handicapped; 6) whether\rthe articles are sold in speciality stores which serve\rhandicapped individuals;  and 7) whether the condition of\rthe articles at the time of importation indicate that these\rarticles are for the handicapped. \r\r     In that case, Customs considered a variety of articles,\rincluding  \""bedside toilet or dressing articles\"" to which\ryour letter refers.  We note that the articles at issue in\rHRL 556449 were not articles of clothing, as in the instant\rcase, but, instead, included toilet support arms, a \""Kommod\""\rbedside toilet, toilet seat raisers and a \""Strumpalatt\"" or\rstocking aid used to used to guide the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> into the\rstocking.  It was with regard to these articles, not\rarticles of clothing, that Customs stated \""the likelihood of\rthe general public utilizing the bedside toilet, or the\rdressing aids at issue is remote\"" and held that \""there is a\rstrong indication that these articles are specially designed\ror adapted for the handicapped.\""\r\r     In analyzing the probability of general public use to\rthe articles under consideration, we note that the patient\rgowns are not designed for street <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, but for use in a\rmedical environment (e.g, hospitals, nursing homes,\rdoctors'offices, birthing centers, etc.)  Within this\rparticular environment, there exists not only a substantial\rprobability of use by the chronically handicapped, but also\ran equally probability that the articles will also be used\rby individuals hospitalized, or otherwise being treated, for\racute or transient disability.  Moreover, the articles are\ralso suitable for use in medical offices for those non-handicapped individuals undergoing diagnostic examination\r(e.g., x-rays, etc.).  Because the subject garments are\requally suitable for use by a large population of \r\r\rpatients, including those who suffer from acute or transient\rdisability and the non-handicapped, the use of the garments\rin this manner is not so improbable as to constitute a\rfugitive use; therefore, we are unable to conclude that the\rgarments will be used predominantly by individuals suffering\rfrom a permanent or chronic physical or mental impairment,\ras required by U.S. Note 4(a), subchapter XVII, Chapter 98,\rHTSUS.\r\r     With regard to the other factors set forth in T.D. 92-77, supra, and HRL 556449, no information has been submitted\rwhich would indicate that the importer of the hospital\rpatient gowns, Eastern Imports, Ltd., is recognized as a\rparty involved in the importation of articles for the\rbenefit of the handicapped.  Although you have attached New\rYork ruling NY 803686, which addressed the eligibility of\radult bibs for entry under subheading 6217.10.0010, HTSUS,\rand have indicated that the requesting party in both cases\ris the same, we note that the fact that a firm has filed two\rrequests for a binding ruling under subheading 9817.00.96,\rHTSUS, does not indicate that it is \""recognized\"" as a party\rinvolved in the importation of articles for the benefit of\rthe handicapped.   Additionally, the patient gowns are not\rsold in speciality stores which serve handicapped\rindividuals, but are sold to other firms who distribute them\rto hospitals and nursing homes, along with sheets, towels,\rbarmops and bibs.  Lastly, there is nothing to suggest that\rthe condition of the articles at the time of importation\rwould indicate that the articles are specially designed or\radapted for use by the handicapped, i.e., those suffering\rchronic and permanent disability, rather than those\rindividuals hospitalized or otherwise being treated for\racute or transient disability or undergoing diagnostic\rexamination.  Accordingly, it is our decision that the\rsubject hospital patient gowns are not \""articles specially\rdesigned or adapted for the handicapped,\"" and, therefore,\rare not eligible for duty-free treatment under subheading\r9817.00.96, HTSUS.  New York Ruling PD  A82009, Supplement\r1, dated May 9, 1996, is hereby affirmed.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     On the basis of the information and sample submitted,\rthe cotton patient hospital gowns which equally suitable for\ruse by a large population of patients, including those who\rsuffer chronic and permanent disability, those who suffer\rfrom acute or transient disability and non-handicapped\rindividuals undergoing diagnostic examination, are not\rconsidered to be an article \""specially designed or adapted\rfor the handicapped,\"" within the meaning of the Nairobi\rProtocol, Annex E, to the Florence Agreement, as codified in\rthe Education, Scientific, and Cultural Materials Act of\r1982, and thus, are not eligible for duty-free treatment\runder subheading 9817.00.96, HTSUS.\r\f\r     A copy of this ruling letter should be attached to the\rentry documents filed at the time this merchandise is\rentered.

After review of that ruling, Customs has determined that the classification for two of the five styles considered has changed from other panty hose or stockings to surgical panty hose or stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  For the reasons that follow, this ruling modifies, in part, NY B87014.\r\rPursuant to section 625(c)(1) Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1625(c)(1)) as amended by section 623 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-82, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186), notice of the proposed modification of NY B87014 was published on January 8, 2003, in the Customs Bulletin, Volume 37, Number 2.  As explained in the notice, the period within which to submit comments on this proposal was until February 7, 2003.  No comments were received in response to this notice.\r\r\r\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe articles under consideration are two styles of compression hosiery, identified in NY B87014 as Style SOFT 241 and Style STRONG 261, which has two types: stocking or panty hose.  In NY B87014, Customs described Style SOFT 241 and Style STRONG 261 as follows:\r\rStyle SOFT 241 25-32 mmHg[1]  below knee, mid thigh, thigh w/belt 62% polyamide, 32% elastane\r\rStyle STRONG 261 25-32 mmHg below knee, mid thigh, thigh, thigh w/belt pantyhose, maternity pantyhose, pantyhose for a man 39% polyamide, 30% elastodiene, 29% polyester, 2% elastane\r\rIn NY B87014, we classified Style SOFT 241 (style 241) and the stocking version of Style STRONG 261 (style 261) in subheading 6115.93.9020, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Other: Of synthetic fibers: Other: Other.\""  The panty hose version of style 261 was classified under subheading 6115.12.2000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Panty hose and tights: Of synthetic fibers, measuring per single yarn 67 decitex or more: Other.\"" \r\rWe presume, as we did in NY B87014, that the measurement per single yarn is 67 decitex or more.  We note that at the time NY B87014 was issued we considered the following:  \r\r  It is Customs position that surgical compression hosiery, because of their construction and application of use were more than simply compression stockings to treat varicose veins.  This hosiery is generally of heavy gauge, opaque, of elasticized knit fabric with either one-way or two-way stretch and is designed to supply compression in the ranges of 30-40 mm mercury to 50-60 mercury.  They are prescribed by physicians for the treatment of venous diseases and other serious conditions such as reversible and irreversible lymphedema and severe post-thrombotic treatment.\r\r  Clinical studies have indicated that surgical stockings for ambulatory patients have a minimum compression 30 mm mercury; have recommended compression figures well above 30 mm mercury for the more serious venous disorders concluding that \""a stocking giving less than 30 mm mercury at the ankle is only able to remove a small amount of vespertine ankle edema\""; compression stockings of less than 30mm mercury are ineffective in the treatment of ambulatory venous disorders; and that hosiery of less than 30mm mercury for such applications as \""for tired and heavy legs, mild swelling, prolonged sitting or standing, etc.\"" are indicative of support hosiery rather than for the specific requirements of surgical stockings.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper classification of the subject graduated compression stockings and panty hose under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.  Merchandise that cannot be classified in accordance with GRI 1 is to be classified in accordance with subsequent GRI taken in order.  The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN), constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the EN provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.\r\rHeading 6115, HTSUSA, provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted.\""  The articles under consideration are made of synthetic fibers and it is presumed for the purposes of this ruling that the yarns measure 67 decitex or more. \r\r\tIn HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, both dated January 2, 2002, Customs classified stockings with graduated compression ranging 20-30 mm Hg as surgical stockings for orthopedic treatment.  To reach our decision, we considered a study evaluating the effects of duration of use of class I (20-30 mm Hg) graduated compression hosiery.  See Robert Weiss, Neil Sadick, Mitchel Goldman, & Margaret Weiss, Post-Sclerotherapy Compression: Controlled Comparative Study of Duration of Compression and its Effects on Clinical Outcome DERMATOL SURG, 35: 105-108 (1999).  This study essentially persuaded our office that compression greater than 20 mm Hg is presently considered necessary for reduction of venous insufficiency.2 We noted certain statements made in the study, including \"" . . . in terms of controlling objective and subjective parameters of venous insufficiency no difference was found between class I (20-30 mm Hg) and class II (30-40 mm Hg) compression stockings.\""  Based on our review, we found that the study suggested that sclerotherapy results overall can be significantly improved by class I compression and should be part of the post-operative sclerotherapy protocol.  In citing other studies, the study concluded that class I (20-30 mm Hg) compression may be recommended over class II since patient compliance is much higher and symptom improvement is identical.  See Jungbeck C, Thulin I, Darenheim C, Norgen L.  Graduated Compression Treatment in Patients with Chronic Venous Insufficiency; A Study Comparing Low and Medium Grade Compression Stockings.  PHLEBOLOGIE, 12:142-5 (1997). \r\rMoreover, during our review of HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, this office examined several letters from vascular surgeons and dermatologists familiar with the beneficial effects of compression on the venous system.  The letters indicated consensus within the medical community that surgical stockings with graduated compression of 20-30 mm Hg are principally used for orthopedic purposes and are primarily prescribed by physicians to prevent or correct bodily deformities and the consequences associated with venous disease.  The letters established that it is widely recognized that 20 mm Hg of compression is considered necessary for the treatment of venous disease.  We noted in HQ 963517 and HQ 963518 that the physicians stated that they recommend using surgical supports with graduated compression of 20 to 30 mm Hg for several reasons: to prevent telangiectatic matting following sclerotherapy, to prevent thrombus formation and phlebitic reactions following sclerotherapy, to reduce post-operative edema, to prevent venous ulcerations, to prevent venous dermatitis and as treatment protocol for post-operative invasive vascular procedures.  \r\rIn HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, Customs determined that physicians generally recommend graduated compression therapy as a treatment for venous insufficiency.  We further recognized that graduated compression hosiery is generally available in three classes of compression; class I specifically covers a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg.  We found that physicians generally prescribe compression stockings and that doctors indicated that patients generally find the hosiery uncomfortable and do not <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them unless directed by a doctor.  Moreover, letters from medical authorities and conversations with medical professionals confirmed that certified and well-trained personnel must measure various parts of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and leg of a patient in order to obtain a proper fit for the stockings.  We also found that pharmacies and medical supply companies prefer that a patient have a prescription that prescribes the amount of compression and noted that stockings obtained by prescription are often covered by insurance.  We observed that graduated compression stockings are significantly more expensive than support hosiery of the types generally found in retail stores, noting that panty hose with 20-30 mm Hg compression typically sell for approximately $75.00 to $100.00 and similar thigh-high stockings typically sell for $60.00 to $95.00 per pair.\r\rAccordingly, in HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, we concluded that surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg should be considered surgical hosiery with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment when prescribed by a physician and/or specially fitted to the patient.  \r\rAs the stockings and panty hose under consideration have a minimum compression of 25 mm Hg, presuming they are prescribed by a physician or professionally fitted, Customs finds that the merchandise is within the scope of surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\r\rHOLDING:\r\rStyles 241 and 261 (below the knee, mid-thigh, thigh, thigh with belt) are classified under subheading 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Other: Of synthetic fibres: Surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\""  The general column one rate of duty is \""Free.\"" \r\rStyle 261 (pantyhose, maternity pantyhose and pantyhose for a man) is classified under subheading 6115.12.1000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Panty hose and tights: Of synthetic fibers, measuring per single yarn 67 decitex or more: Surgical panty hose with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\"" The general column one rate of duty is \""Free.\"" \r\rNY B87014 is hereby MODIFIED, in part.

Harmon, Director\rCommercial Rulings Division\r1 Compression is measured by how much pressure is required to elevate a column of Mercury (Hg) a certain distance, as measured in millimeters (mm).\r2  The partial failure of leg veins to carry blood up towards the heart results in venous disorders, which vary in severity from mild varicosity to deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.  The use of graduated compression stockings is one of the methods used in the prevention and treatment of these disorders.  The stockings are constructed so that the maximum pressure is exerted at the ankle and gradually decreasing up the leg, thus achieving a milking effect that helps blood rise toward the heart.  \r5\r\r\r\r2\r\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/2003/965914.doc"",""id"":20306,""rulingNumber"":""965914"",""subject"":""Modification of New York Ruling Letter B87014, dated August 6, 1997; Classification of Medical Graduated Compression Stockings and Panty Hose"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""2003-02-12T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""B87014"",""963517"",""963518""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[""B87014""],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6115.12.1000"",""6115.93.3000""]}"

The stockings are constructed so that the maximum pressure is exerted at the ankle and gradually decreasing up the leg, thus achieving a milking effect that helps blood rise toward the heart.  \r5\r\r\r\r2\r\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/2003/965921.doc"",""id"":20312,""rulingNumber"":""965921"",""subject"":""Modification of New York Ruling Letter E82596, dated June 11, 1999; Classification of Medical Graduated Compression Stockings"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""2003-02-12T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""E82596"",""963517"",""963518""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[""E82596""],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6115.93.3000""]}"

Kerven\rDistrict Director of Customs\rU.S. Customs Service\r300 Second Avenue, South\rGreat Falls, Montana 59401\r\rRE:  Application for further review of protest no. 3304-93-\r100041; classification of used railroad ties; landscaping\rtimbers; principal use; condition as imported; HRL 954924\r\rDear Mr. Kerven:\r\r     This is a decision on an application for further review of a\rprotest timely filed by Holje Customs Brokers, Inc., on behalf of\rCando Contracting.  The protest objects to your decision\rconcerning the classification of used railroad ties imported into\rthe United States for use as landscaping timbers.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The merchandise at issue are 6 inch x 8 inch x 9 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> pieces\rof lumber that have been used as railroad ties in Canada.  After\rsuch use, they are imported into the United States for use\rprincipally in landscaping.  They are not imported for use as\rrailroad ties, nor are they so used, in the United States.\r\r     The Customs Protest and Summons Information Report (CF\r6445A) indicates that the used ties, by the time of entry,\rprobably have been in use in Canada as railroad ties for\rapproximately 25 years.  Consequently, they would be notched from\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  Also, they would have been treated with creosote prior to\rbeing put into use initially as railroad ties.\r\r     The used ties were entered on July 21, 1993, under\rsubheading 4406.90.0000, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United\rStates Annotated (HTSUSA), which provides for railroad ties of\rwood that have been impregnated.  On September 14, 1993, Customs\rissued a Notice of Action (CF 29) informing the importer that the\rentry was to be liquidated under subheading 4421.90.9540, HTSUSA,\rwhich provides for other articles of wood.  The entry was\rliquidated on November 5, 1993, and this protest was timely filed\ron November 19, 1993.  In the protest, the importer contends that\rthe used ties should be classified as railroad ties under heading\r4406, HTSUSA.  \r\rISSUE:\r\r     Are used railroad ties that are no longer suitable for use\ras railroad ties and are imported for use principally as\rlandscape timbers classifiable as railroad ties under heading\r4406, HTSUSA, and, if not, what is the proper classification? \r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     In Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL) 954924, dated December\r7, 1993, we addressed the issue of classification of used\rrailroad ties from Canada.  There, the used ties were described\ras no longer fit for use as railroad ties.  They were imported\rfor use as landscaping timbers.  They were not being sold to, or\rused by, railroad companies.  The ruling held the following:\r\r     Used railroad ties that no longer meet the\r     specifications for railroad ties and are used as\r     landscaping timbers are classifiable, if not further\r     manufactured, under heading 4407, HTSUSA, as wood sawn\r     lengthwise of a thickness exceeding 6 mm.  (Holes made\r     by spikes or other nails is not evidence of further\r     manufacturing.)  The type of wood and other\r     characteristics will determine the precise subheading. \r     . . .  If the used railroad ties are further\r     manufactured, they are classifiable as other articles\r     of wood under heading 4421, HTSUSA. \r\rThe recipient of HRL 954924, a customs broker, submitted that\rruling request on behalf of the party in this protest identified\ron the CF 6445A as the seller and shipper, Cando Contracting of\rBrandon, Manitoba, Canada.  It appears that the used ties that\rwere ruled upon in HRL 954924 are the same kind of ties at issue\rin this protest.\r\r     The only contention in this protest is that used railroad\rties are nonetheless railroad ties and should be so classified\rregardless of their condition or their use after importation as\rlandscape timbers.  It is argued that heading 4406, HTSUSA, is\rnot a use provision and that railroad ties, new or used, should\rbe classified as such under that eo nomine provision.\r\r     Heading 4406, HTSUSA, provides for the following:\r\r     4406 Railway or tramway sleepers (cross-ties) of wood:\r\r     4406.10.00     Not impregnated.\r\r     4406.90.00     Other.\r\rThe Explanatory Notes (EN's) to the Harmonized Commodity\rDescription and Coding System provide the following for heading\r44.06 (Vol. 2, p. 626):\r\r       This heading covers unplaned wood in pieces of more\r     or less rectangular section of the kind commonly used\r     to support railway or tramway track.  The heading also\r     includes switch ties, which are longer than sleepers,\r     and bridge ties, which are wider and thicker and\r     usually longer than sleepers.\r\r       The edges of these products may be roughly chamfered\r     and they may be provided with holes or seatings for\r     fixing the rails or chairs.  They may also sometimes be\r     strengthened at the ends by means of staples, nails,\r     bolts or steel strips to prevent their splitting.\r\r       The products of this heading may be surface treated\r     with insecticides or fungicides for the purpose of\r     protection.  For long-term preservation, they are often\r     impregnated with creosote or other substances.\r     \rThe language of the heading and the EN's clearly indicates that\rheading 4406, HTSUSA, is a use provision.  It covers sawn pieces\rof lumber used for tracking, such as railroad track and tramway\rtrack: sleepers, switch ties, and bridge ties.  We do not agree\rwith the claim made in the protest that heading 4406, HTSUSA, is\rnot a use provision.  (Note that a tariff provision based on use\rneed not contain the words \""used for,\"" or something similar. \rE.C. Lineiro v. United States, 37 CCPA 10, 14, C.A.D. 411\r(1949).)\r\r     Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a) provides the\rfollowing:\r\r     1.  In the absence of special language or context which\r     otherwise requires --\r\r          (a)  a tariff classification controlled by use\r     (other than actual use) is to be determined in\r     accordance with the use in the United States at, or\r     immediately prior to, the date of importation, of goods\r     of that class or kind to which the imported goods\r     belong, and the controlling use is the principal use.\r\rOne effect of designating a tariff provision as a use provision\ris to require that a particular article belong to a certain class\ror kind of article  in order to be classified within that\rprovision.  If it belongs to that class or kind of article, it is\rclassifiable within that provision regardless of how it is used\rafter importation.  (The class or kind is defined by the\rprincipal use of that class or kind of article in the United\rStates at or immediately before the time of entry.)  Railroad\rties are used for railroad tracking.  In fact, they must meet\rcertain specifications of the American Railway Engineering\rAssociation in order to be so used.  This limitation, an\rimportant safety standard, defines the class.  Sawn pieces of\rlumber that do not meet specifications cannot be used as railroad\rties and thus fall outside the class; sawn pieces of lumber that\rmeet specifications can be used as railroad ties and are within\rthe class.\r\r     The goods at issue in this protest - whether they are\rreferred to as pieces of lumber or used railroad ties - are\rimported into the United States in a used condition, such that\rthey do not meet requisite specifications and are no longer\rusable as railroad ties; instead, they are used principally as\rlandscape timbers.  Goods are classified under the HTSUS in their\rcondition as imported.  United States v. Citreon, 223 U.S. 407\r(1911).  The NIS for this commodity stated that used railroad\rties are used principally in the landscaping business.  Since the\rused railroad ties in question, unlike new, unused railroad ties,\rare not used principally as railroad ties, they are not\rclassifiable as railroad ties within the scope of heading 4406,\rHTSUSA; they are not of the class or kind of sawn lumber which\rqualify for use as railroad ties.\r\r     The CF 6445A cites several rulings that are alleged to\rsupport the importer's view that a used article is nonetheless\rclassified in the tariff provision providing for that article. \rIt would follow from this proposition that the used railroad ties\rshould be classified as railroad ties in heading 4406, HTSUSA. \rAlthough we do not here rule on this proposition, neither do we\rreject it.  On certain facts, it may apply.  However, on the\rfacts of the instant case, it is inapplicable.  Further, three of\rthe four rulings cited do not support the proposition or the\rimporter's contention that the used ties at issue should be\rclassified as railroad ties.  In New York Ruling Letter (NYRL)\r863044, dated May 16, 1991, Customs classified non-reusable wood\rpallets that were crushed and broken under subheading\r4401.30.4090, HTSUSA, which provides for wood waste and scrap,\rnot as wood pallets under heading 4415, HTSUSA.  In NYRL 884063,\rdated April 1, 1993, reusable wood pallets were classified under\rheading 4415, HTSUSA, and non-reusable pallets were classified as\rwood waste and scrap under heading 4401, HTSUSA.  In NYRL 867195,\rdated October 9, 1991, Customs classified as netting articles\rmade from used (worn out) commercial fishnetting.  The imported\rarticles were not \""used fishnetting\""; they were articles in their\rown right made from material cut from used fishnetting.  The\rother ruling cited, Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL) 951326,\rdated May 29, 1992, classified used lead-acid batteries as\rbatteries under heading 8507, HTSUSA.  They had been entered as\rlead waste and scrap under heading 7802, HTSUSA.  It was\rdetermined that both headings applied equally to the used\rbatteries and that neither aspect of the articles imparted\ressential character.  Therefore, the batteries were classified\runder the heading for batteries on the basis of GRI 3(c).  This\rcase is also distinguishable from the instant case, where used\rrailroad ties do not meet the specifications for railroad ties,\rare imported for use principally as landscape timbers, and thus\rdo not fall within the class or kind of sawn wood used as\rrailroad ties. \r\r     Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the rulings cited\rin the CF 6445A are not applicable to the instant case. \r\r     Finally, after review of the arguments made in this protest,\rwhich necessarily have prompted a review of HRL 954924, we\rconclude that the ruling is correct in its holding that used\rrailroad ties that no longer meet specifications for use as\rrailroad ties and are imported into the United States for use as\rlandscape timbers are not classifiable as railroad ties under\rheading 4406, HTSUSA.  As stated in that ruling, such ties are\rclassifiable under heading 4407, HTSUSA, which provides for sawn\rpieces of lumber exceeding a thickness of 6 mm, unless they have\rbeen advanced by processing beyond planing, sanding, or finger-\rjointing, in which case they would be classifiable under heading\r4421, HTSUSA, which provides for other articles of wood not\rprovided for in other headings of Chapter 44.  The merchandise at\rissue in this protest was classified in subheading 4421.90.9540,\rHTSUSA.  We assume that the used ties were advanced in some way\rsufficient to warrant classification in that heading.  This\rinformation is not contained in the protest record.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     This protest is DENIED.  Used railroad ties that no longer\rmeet specifications for use as railroad ties are sawn pieces of\rlumber used principally as landscape timbers.  If further\rmanufactured, they are classifiable in subheading 4421.90.9540,\rHTSUSA.  If not further manufactured, they are classifiable under\rheading 4407, HTSUSA.  The precise subheading under heading 4407,\rHTSUSA, will depend on the type of wood and other\rcharacteristics.  We note that merchandise classified in heading\r4407, HTSUSA, that is of a softwood variety falling within the\rscope of the Canadian lumber CVD order should be processed\raccordingly.\r\r     In accordance with Section 3A(11)(b) of Customs Directive\r099 3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject: Revised Protest\rDirective, this decision should be mailed by your office to the\rPROTESTANT no later than 60 days from the date of this letter. \rAny reliquidation of the entries in accordance with the decision\rmust be accomplished prior to mailing of the decision.

"{""text"":""\rHQ 965919\r\rFebruary 12, 2003\r\rCLA-2  RR:CR:TE  965919 ttd\r\rCATEGORY:  Classification\r\rTARIFF NO.: 6115.92.3000\r\rMr. Tom Miesen\rGloria-Med America, Inc.\r1813 E. John Sims Parkway, Suite 3\rNiceville, FL 32578\r\rRE:  \tModification of New York Ruling Letter E82594, dated June 11, 1999; Classification of Medical Graduated Compression Stockings\r\rDear Mr. Miesen:\r\rThis letter concerns New York Ruling Letter (NY) E82594, issued to you on June 11, 1999, regarding the tariff classification of compression hosiery under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA).  After review of that ruling, Customs has determined that the classification for one of the two styles considered has changed from subheading 6115.92.9000, HTSUSA, as other stockings to subheading 6115.92.3000, HTSUSA, as surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  For the reasons that follow, this ruling modifies, in part, NY E82594.\r\rPursuant to section 625(c)(1) Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1625(c)(1)) as amended by section 623 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-82, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186), notice of the proposed modification of NY E82594 was published on January 8, 2003, in the Customs Bulletin, Volume 37, Number 2.  As explained in the notice, the period within which to submit comments on this proposal was until February 7, 2003.  No comments were received in response to this notice.\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe article under consideration is one style of compression hosiery, identified in NY E82594 as Style Cotton 162 (style 162).  Style 162 is knee-high and comprised of 66 percent cotton, 17 percent polyamide and 17 percent elastane fabric, with a decitex of 486.  It features a covered heel, open toe and elastic band at the top.  Style 162 supplies graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg1 and is prescribed by a physician.  \r\rIn NY E82594, Customs classified style 162 in subheading 6115.92.9000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Other: Of cotton: Other: Other.\""  We note that at the time NY E82594 was issued we considered the following:  \r\rIt is Customs position that surgical compression hosiery, because of their construction and application of use, are more than simple compression stockings to treat varicose veins.  The hosiery is made of heavy gauge, opaque, elasticized knit fabric, and is designed to supply compression in the range of 30-40 mm mercury to 50-60 mercury.  They are prescribed by physicians for the treatment of venous diseases and other serious conditions such as reversible and irreversible lymphedema and severe post-thrombotic treatment.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper classification of the subject graduated compression hosiery under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.  Merchandise that cannot be classified in accordance with GRI 1 is to be classified in accordance with subsequent GRI taken in order.  The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN), constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the EN provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUSA and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.\r\rHeading 6115, HTSUSA, provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted.\""  \r\r\tIn HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, both dated January 2, 2002, Customs classified stockings with graduated compression ranging 20-30 mm Hg as surgical stockings for orthopedic treatment.  To reach our decision, we considered a study evaluating the effects of duration of use of class I (20-30 mm Hg) graduated compression hosiery.  See Robert Weiss, Neil Sadick, Mitchel Goldman, & Margaret Weiss, Post-Sclerotherapy Compression: Controlled Comparative Study of Duration of Compression and its Effects on Clinical Outcome DERMATOL SURG, 35: 105-108 (1999).  This study essentially persuaded our office that compression greater than 20 mm Hg is presently considered necessary for reduction of venous insufficiency.2 We noted certain statements made in the study, including \"" . . . in terms of controlling objective and subjective parameters of venous insufficiency no difference was found between class I (20-30 mm Hg) and class II (30-40 mm Hg) compression stockings.\""  Based on our review, we found that the study suggested that sclerotherapy results overall can be significantly improved by class I compression and should be part of the post-operative sclerotherapy protocol.  In citing other studies, the study concluded that class I (20-30 mm Hg) compression may be recommended over class II since patient compliance is much higher and symptom improvement is identical.  See Jungbeck C, Thulin I, Darenheim C, Norgen L.  Graduated Compression Treatment in Patients with Chronic Venous Insufficiency; A Study Comparing Low and Medium Grade Compression Stockings.  PHLEBOLOGIE, 12:142-5 (1997). \r\rMoreover, during our review of HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, this office examined several letters from vascular surgeons and dermatologists familiar with the beneficial effects of compression on the venous system.  The letters indicated consensus within the medical community that surgical stockings with graduated compression of 20-30 mm Hg are principally used for orthopedic purposes and are primarily prescribed by physicians to prevent or correct bodily deformities and the consequences associated with venous disease.  The letters established that it is widely recognized that 20 mm Hg of compression is considered necessary for the treatment of venous disease.  We noted in HQ 963517 and HQ 963518 that the physicians stated that they recommend using surgical supports with graduated compression of 20 to 30 mm Hg for several reasons: to prevent telangiectatic matting following sclerotherapy, to prevent thrombus formation and phlebitic reactions following sclerotherapy, to reduce post-operative edema, to prevent venous ulcerations, to prevent venous dermatitis and as treatment protocol for post-operative invasive vascular procedures.  \r\rIn HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, Customs determined that physicians generally recommend graduated compression therapy as a treatment for venous insufficiency.  We further recognized that graduated compression hosiery is generally available in three classes of compression; class I specifically covers a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg.  We found that physicians generally prescribe compression stockings and that doctors indicated that patients generally find the hosiery uncomfortable and do not <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them unless directed by a doctor.  Moreover, letters from medical authorities and conversations with medical professionals confirmed that certified and well-trained personnel must measure various parts of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and leg of a patient in order to obtain a proper fit for the stockings.  We also found that pharmacies and medical supply companies prefer that a patient have a prescription that prescribes the amount of compression and noted that stockings obtained by prescription are often covered by insurance.  We observed that graduated compression stockings are significantly more expensive than support hosiery of the types generally found in retail stores, noting that panty hose with 20-30 mm Hg compression typically sell for approximately $75.00 to $100.00 and similar thigh-high stockings typically sell for $60.00 to $95.00 per pair.\r\rAccordingly, in HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, we concluded that surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg should be considered surgical hosiery with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment when prescribed by a physician and/or specially fitted to the patient.  \r\rAs the subject merchandise has a graduated compression range of 20-30 mm Hg and is prescribed by a physician, Customs finds the instant graduated compression hosiery is within the scope of subheading 6115.92.3000, HTSUSA, providing for surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\r\rHOLDING:\r\rBased on the foregoing, style 162 is classified under subheading 6115.92.3000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Other: Of cotton: Surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\"" The general column one rate of duty is \""Free.\"" \r\rNY E82594 is hereby MODIFIED, in part.  In accordance with 19 U.S.C. §1625(c), this ruling will become effective 60 days after its publication in the Customs Bulletin.\r\rSincerely,\r\r\r\rMyles B.

A sample was submitted for\rexamination and will be returned under separate cover.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The submitted sample, referred to as a men's alpine climbing\rsuit, style number 3100, is a one-piece coverall designed for\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> during mountain climbing.  It has a front zipper opening\rextending from the crotch to the top of the collar (which has an\relasticized drawstring), and which is partially covered by two\rflaps with VELCRO closures. The garment has a tunnelled belt at\rthe waist, vertical opening zippered pockets above the waist, a\rhorizontal opening zippered pocket in the rear, and elasticized\rstorm cuffs at the ankles.  The legs have various two way zippers\rto facilitate getting the garment on and off.\r\r     The upper half of the garment is comprised, in part, of a\rknitted, heavily napped, polyester fleece fabric, extending from\rthe shoulders to the mid-chest area, and also covering the\rinternal portion of the collar.

The garment also features some mesh for ventilation under\rboth sleeves from the shoulder seams to the elbows.\r     The lower half of the garment is constructed of a three-\rlayer Gore-Tex fabric, which consists of a plastic membrane\rcovered on the outer surface with a woven textile fabric and on\rthe inner surface with a knitted textile fabric, both of man-\rmade fibers.\r\r     Data submitted comparing the Gore-Tex and non-Gore-Tex\rcomponents of the garment indicates the following information\rregarding approximate surface area and cost per yard: \r\r     Gore-Tex:                        Non-Gore-Tex:\r\r     - 52.8 percent                   - 47.2 percent \r     - $15.98 per yard                  - Nylon - $4.28 per yard\r                                        - Fleece - $7.50 per yard\r\r     Based on the data given, the figures suggest a value ratio\rof approximately 74 percent for Gore-Tex and 26 percent for the\rother fabrics. Though approximate weights of the different\rfabrics were not provided, a preliminary examination by our New\rYork office indicates that the fleece weighs approximately 27\rpercent more than the Gore-Tex lamination per square <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.\rOverall, this results in a 19 percent weight advantage for the\rGore-Tex over the fleece, based on the stated ratio of 52.8\rpercent of the surface for Gore-Tex and 34.6 percent for the\rfleece.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Whether the subject garment is classifiable in heading 6210,\rHTSUSA, as an article made up of fabrics of heading 5602, 5603,\r5903, 5906 or 5907, or in heading 6211, HTSUSA, as men's or boys'\rwoven other garment or, in heading 6114, HTSUSA, as a men's or\rboys' knit other garment?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of merchandise under the HTSUSA is governed\rby the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI's).  GRI 1 requires\rthat classification be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, taken in\rorder.  Where goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of\rGRI 1, the remaining GRI's will be applied, in the order of their\rappearance.\r\r     Subheading Note 2 to Section XI HTSUSA, provides in\rpertinent part:\r\r\r\r\r\r     (A) Products of Chapters 56 to 63 containing two or more    \r         textile materials are to be regarded as consisting      \r         wholly of that textile material which would be selected \r         under Note 2 to this Section for the classification of a \r         product of Chapters 50 to 55 consisting of the same     \r         textile materials.\r\r     (B) For the application of this rule:\r\r         (a) Where appropriate, only the part which determines   \r             the classification under Interpretative Rule 3 shall \r             be taken into account.\r\r     Note 2(A), Section XI, to which Subheading Note 2(A) refers,\rprovides:\r\r     Goods classifiable in Chapters 50 to 55 or in Heading \r     No. 58.09 or 59.02 and of a mixture of two or more textile\r     materials are to be classified as if consisting wholly of\r     that one textile material which predominates by weight over\r     any other single textile material.\r\r     Before the Subheading Note, which is predicated on the\rSection Note, can be utilized, it must first be determined to\rwhich of the fabrics comprising the article, the Section Note\r(and therefore the Subheading Note) applies.\r\r     As was determined in HQ 950990, dated July 29, 1992,\r(regarding the classification of a reversible men's knitted\rpullover), when a garment is constructed of more than one\rmaterial, any consideration of the headings that classify the\rarticle must first be predicated on a determination of which\rconstituent material determines the classification of the\rmerchandise.  \r\r     Usually apparel is classified under the HTSUSA according to\r     its outer shell.  Accordingly, goods of chapter 61 with\r     relatively unimportant linings, shoulder pads, pockets,\r     etc., would be classified according to Subheading Note 2(A),\r     Section XI, without considering those trimmings.  However,\r     where those goods have parts or accessories that contribute\r     materially to their character or usefulness (for example,\r     heavy weight linings which provide a substantial degree of\r     warmth to the wearer), then those parts or accessories must\r     be considered along with the outer shell in determining the\r     applicable classification.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     The classification of garments composed of different\rmaterials was discussed at length in Customs Memorandum file\r084118, dated April 13, 1989. Therein factors for determining the\ressential character of garments were enumerated.  For full body\rgarments, those factors were as follows:\r\r     In the case of full body garments, that component which\r     comprises the visible upper portion will determine the\r     classification; however, classification will be according to\r     GRI 3(b) or 3(c), as appropriate, if the other component:\r\r     (1) provides a significant visual effect (e.g., a           \r         substantial amount of lace); or\r\r     (2) is over 60 percent by weight of the garment; or\r\r     (3) is valued at more than 2 times the primary component.\r\r     Thus, the analysis involves a determination of whether any\rone component from which the article is constructed, imparts the\ressential character to the garment.\r\r     The competing provisions for this article are: heading 6210,\rHTSUSA, which provides for garments made up of fabrics of heading\rNo. 5602, 5603, 5903, 5906 or 5907; heading 6211, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for men's or boys' woven other garments; and heading\r6214, HTSUSA, which provides for men's or boys' knit other\rgarments.\r\r     Based on the figures submitted with the article, the Gore-\rTex portion is valued at more than two times the other\rcomponents.  As this is one of the requisite enumerated\rconditions which must precede a GRI 3 analysis (as per Customs\rMemo 084118, regarding the classification of garments composed of\rdifferent materials), we are directed to proceed to GRI 3(b) or\r3(c), as is appropriate.\r\r     The Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity\rDescription and Coding System, (EN), constitute the official\rinterpretation of the tariff at the international level. GRI 3(b)\rprovides:\r\r     Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials\r     or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets\r     for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to\r     3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the\r     material or component which gives them their essential\r     character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.\r\r\r\r\r     Gore-Tex fabric is used in garments to protect against\rinclement weather, specifically providing wind resistance,\rwaterproof protection, and to a degree, the transpiration of\rperspiration in the form of water vapor.  The top portion of the\rgarment is made of non-Gore-Tex fabrics.  Specifically, it is\rconstructed from fleece which has no wind or water resistance\rproperties, but provides warmth to the wearer.  In addition, the\rgarment also features woven nylon and, mesh for the purpose of\rventing perspiration.   \r     \r     Customs concluded in T.D. 91-78 that\r\r     garments consisting of different fabrics should not be\r     classified in Headings 6113 or 6210, HTSUS, unless one of\r     the fabrics listed in those Headings is determined to impart\r     the essential character to the garment in question. \r\r     This is consistent with existing policy that a fabric\rimparts the essential character to a garment only when the fabric\r\""creates its identity\"".  See also, HQ 088720, dated June 25,\r1991.\r\r     In this case, only the lower half of the garment is made\rfrom Gore-Tex lamination.  As a whole therefore, the garment will\rnot keep one dry or protect one from the wind.  On the other\rhand, the Gore-Tex, having no insulating properties, will do\rlittle to keep one warm other than give wind resistance.  This\rgarment is a composite good in the truest sense of the term--\reach component performs a distinctly different function, which\rwhen combined, form a product which is neither distinctly Gore-\rTex nor fleece.\r\r     The EN to GRI 3(b) provide guidance in determining essential\rcharacter:\r\r     (VIII) The factor which determines essential character will\r            vary as between different kinds of goods.  It may,   \r            for example, be determined by the nature of the      \r            material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight, or \r            value, or by the role of a constituent material in   \r            relation to the use of the goods.\r\r     It cannot be said that the fleece upper portion (provided\rfor in heading 6114, HTSUSA), creates the \""identity of the\rgarment\"", nor can it be said that the identity of the garment is\rimparted by its woven components (provided for in heading 6211,\rHTSUSA).  \r\r \r\r\r\r     Based on the data submitted with the ruling request, the\rGore-Tex portion of the garment exceeds all other components\r(fleece, woven and mesh), in value, quantity and, weight.  As\rthese factorss are explicitly mentioned as important\rconsiderations to a GRI 3(b) determination, it is Customs'\rposition that this garment qualifies as a garment classifiable in\rheading 6210, HTSUSA.  \r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The submitted sample, a men's alpinist climbing suit, style\rnumber 3100, is classified in subheading 621O.40.1040, HTSUSA,\rwhich provides for other men's or boys' coveralls, made up of\rfabrics of headings 5602, 5603, 5903, 5906 or 5907.  The\rapplicable rate of duty is 7.6 percent ad valorem and the quota\rcategory is 659.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since\rpart categories are the result of international bilateral\ragreements which are subject to frequent negotiations and\rchanges, we suggest that your client check, close to the time of\rshipment, the Status Report on Current Import Quotas (Restraint\rLevels), and issuance of the U.S. Customs Service which is\rupdated weekly and is available at the local Customs office.\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories, your client should contact the\rlocal Customs office prior to importing the merchandise to\rdetermine the current status of any import restraints or\rrequirements.\r\r\r                           Sincerely,\r\r\r\r\r                           John Durant, Director\r                           Commercial Rulings Division\r\u001A\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1993/953239.doc"",""id"":9223,""rulingNumber"":""953239"",""subject"":""Classification of a men's alpinist climbing suit; garment     constructed of a variety of fabrics; TD 91-78; Customs     Memorandum 084118; classification as per GRI 3(b);     subheading 6210.40.1040, HTSUSA."",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1993-04-06T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""950990"",""088720""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6210.40.1040""]}"

Box 20, Highway 52 South\rCannon Falls, Minnesota 55009-0020\r\rRE:  Five Garlands\r\rDear Ms. Althoff:\r\r     This letter is in response to your inquiry of October 26,\r1992, concerning the tariff classifications of the five separate\rgarlands identified above, which have been, and/or will be\rimported from Taiwan or China, by Midwest Importers of Cannon\rFalls, Inc.  A sample of each item was submitted with your\rinquiry.  \r\rFACTS:\r\r     The articles at issue are five garlands, each referred to\rand sold as a \""CHRISTMAS TIME GARLAND,\"" and individually\ridentified by the following item numbers and descriptions:  \r\r     Item no. 7267-9, which is described as a paper wired\r     plaid garland, measures 8 feet by 2-1/4 inches, is red,\r     green, yellow, black, and brown in color, and has wire\r     enclosed within the paper on its borders.  \r\r     Item no. 1664-3, which is described as a fabric gold\r     trimmed burgundy garland (of artificial fibers),\r     measures 8 feet by 2-1/2 inches, is burgundy in color,\r     is hemmed at each end, and has wire sewn into its\r     golden borders.   \r                               -2-\r\r     Item no. 5496-6, described as a burgundy green gold\r     garland, is a braided cord of artificial fibers in\r     three colors, measuring 1/2 inch in diameter by 8 feet,\r     including its unbraided, tassel ends.  \r\r     Item no. 2834-1, described as a wood Santa head\r     garland, is an 8 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> string of wooden beads,\r     essentially red, green, beige, and white in color,\r     measuring approximately 1/2 inch in diameter, with\r     every sixth bead being twice as large, and painted to\r     represent Santa's head, cap, and beard.\r\r     Item no. 08996-5, which is described as a gold wired\r     fabric garland, measures 25 feet by 2 1/2 inches, is\r     comprised of metalized fabric (not hemmed), is\r     translucent metallic gold in color, and has wire sewn\r     into its borders.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Whether the garlands are classifiable in heading 9505, as\rfestive articles; in heading 5806, as articles of other narrow\rwoven fabrics; in heading 5609, as articles of yarn, cordage, or\rrope; or in heading 6307, as other made up textile articles. \r                                                  \rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification under the HTSUSA is made in accordance with\rthe General Rules of Interpretation (GRI's).  The systematic\rdetail of the harmonized system is such that virtually all goods\rare classified by application of GRI 1, that is, according to the\rterms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative\rSection or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be\rclassified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and\rlegal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI's may\rthen be applied.  The Explanatory Notes (EN's) to the Harmonized\rCommodity Description and Coding System, which represent the\rofficial interpretation of the tariff at the international level,\rfacilitate classification under the HTSUSA by offering guidance\rin understanding the scope of the headings and GRI's.\r\r     Heading 9505, HTSUSA, provides for, among other items,\rfestive, carnival, and other entertainment articles.  The EN to\r9505 indicates that the heading covers: \r                               -3-\r\r     (A) Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles, which\r     in view of their intended use are generally made of non-\r     durable material.  They include:\r\r          (1) Decorations such as festoons, garlands, Chinese\r          lanterns, etc., as well as various decorative articles\r          made of paper, metal foil, glass fibre, etc., for\r          Christmas trees (e.g., tinsel, stars, icicles),\r          artificial snow, coloured balls, bells, lanterns, etc. \r          Cake and other decorations (e.g., animals, flags) which\r          are traditionally associated with a particular festival\r          are also classified here.\r\r          (2) Articles traditionally used at Christmas\r          festivities, e.g., artificial Christmas trees (these\r          are sometimes of the folding type), nativity scenes,\r          Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings, imitation yule\r          logs....\r\r\r     In general, merchandise is classifiable in heading 9505,\rHTSUSA, as a festive article when the article, as a whole:\r\r     1.   is of non-durable material or, generally, is not\r          purchased because of its extreme worth, or intrinsic\r          value (e.g., paper, cardboard, metal foil, glass fiber,\r          plastic, wood);\r\r     2.   functions primarily as a decoration (e.g., its primary\r          function is not utilitarian); and\r\r     3.   is traditionally associated or used with a particular\r          festival (e.g., stockings and tree ornaments for\r          Christmas, decorative eggs for Easter).\r\r     An article's satisfaction of these three criteria is\rindicative of classification as a festive article.  The motif of\ran item is not dispositive of its classification and,\rconsequently, does not transform an item into a festive article.\r\r     It is Customs position that certain types of garlands may be\rclassified as traditional, festive articles (See Headquarters\rRuling Letter (HRL) 950999, issued April 16, 1992).  The subject\rfive garlands are made of non-durable material.  Customs\rconsiders articles such as these, to be made of non-durable\rmaterial when they are not designed for sustained <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and tear,\rand are not purchased for their extreme worth or value (as would  \r                               -4-\r\rbe decorative, yet costly pieces of art or crystal).  In\raddition, the primary function of each of the five items is\rdecorative, as opposed to utilitarian.  \r\r     However, upon examination of each article as a whole, it is\rapparent that three of the five garlands (item nos. 1664-3,\r5496-6, and 08996-5) are not traditionally associated with or\rused for the particular festival of Christmas.  On the contrary,\rthese three items have potentially diverse functions throughout\rthe year as, for example, home decoration (for furniture,\rcurtains, lamps, window shades), apparel (for hats, blouses,\retc.), and gift wrapping.  Since item nos. 1664-3, 5496-6, and\r08996-5, cannot be classified as festive articles, they must be\rclassified elsewhere.\r\r     Subheading 9505.10 includes articles for Christmas\rfestivities.  At the eight digit subheading level, subheading\r9505.10.15 covers Christmas ornaments comprised of wood.  To\rqualify as a Christmas ornament, Customs looks to the following\rthree criteria:\r\r     1.   that the item is advertised and sold as a Christmas\r          tree ornament;\r\r     2.   that there is some method, generally a loop attached to\r          the top, to hang the item on a tree; and\r\r     3.   that the item is not too big or too heavy to be hung or\r          attached to a tree.\r\r     It is apparent that item no. 2834-1, the wooden beaded Santa\rgarland, meets these criteria and is properly classified as a\rChristmas ornament in subheading 9505.10.15.  On the other hand,\rdue to its paper composition, and considerable tensile strength,\rthe paper wired plaid garland (item no. 7267-9) is ill-suited for\rhanging on a Christmas tree.  This tightly wound festive article\ris properly classified in subheading 9505.90.40, HTSUSA, the\rprovision for confetti, paper spirals or streamers.\r\r     With respect to item no. 1664-3, the fabric gold trimmed\rburgundy garland, heading 6307 provides for other made up textile\rarticles.  Note 7(c) to Section XI, HTSUSA, states that the\rexpression \""made up\"" means \""[h]emmed or with rolled edges....\"" \rNotes 1 and 2 to chapter 63, HTSUSA, states that subchapter 1\r(headings 6301 through 6307) applies only to made up articles of \r                               -5-\r\rany textile fabric, and does not cover goods of chapters 56 to\r62.  Subheading 6307.90.9986, covers other made up articles\r(other than towels, textile shells, and national flags), and is\rthe proper classification for this made up article. \r\r     With respect to item no. 08996-5, heading 5806 provides for\rnarrow woven fabrics.  Subheading 5806.39.3020, covers other\rnarrow woven fabrics of metalized yarn, and is the proper\rclassification for the gold wired fabric garland.\r\r     Finally, with respect to item no. 5496-6, the burgundy,\rgreen, gold garland, heading 5609 provides for articles of yarn,\rcordage, rope or cables.  Such articles, when comprised of man-\rmade fibers, are classified in subheading 5609.00.3000, which is\rthe proper classification for item no. 5496-6.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The wood Santa head garland is classified in subheading\r9505.10.1500, HTSUSA, as \""Festive, carnival or other\rentertainment articles,...Articles for Christmas festivities and\rparts and accessories thereof: Christmas ornaments: Other: Of\rwood.\""  The general column one rate of duty is 5.1 percent ad\rvalorem.\r\r     The paper wired plaid garland is classified in subheading\r9505.90.4000, HTSUSA, as \""Festive, carnival or other\rentertainment articles,...Other: Confetti, paper spirals or\rstreamers....\""  The general column one rate of duty is 4 percent\rad valorem.\r\r     The fabric gold trimmed burgundy garland is classified in\rsubheading 6307.90.9986, HTSUSA, as \""Other made up articles,...:\rOther: Other: Other: Other: Other.\""  The general column one rate\rof duty is 7 percent ad valorem.\r\r     The gold wired fabric garland is classified in subheading\r5806.39.3020, HTSUSA, textile category 229, as \""Narrow woven\rfabrics,...: Other woven fabrics: Of other textile materials:\rOther: Other: Of metalized yarn.\""  The general column one rate of\rduty is 3 percent ad valorem.\r\r     The burgundy, green, gold garland is classified in\rsubheading 5609.00.3000, HTSUSA, as \""Articles of yarn...cordage,\rrope or cables...: Of man-made fibers.\""  The general column one\rrate of duty is 9 percent ad valorem. \r                               -6-\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories applicable to textile\rmerchandise, you should contact your local Customs office prior\rto importation of this merchandise to determine the current\rstatus of any import restraints or requirements.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since\rpart categories are the result of international bilateral\ragreements which are subject to frequent renegotiations and\rchanges, to obtain the most current information available, we\rsuggest that you check, close to the time of shipment, the Status\rReport On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an internal\rissuance of the U.S. Customs Service, which is available for\rinspection at your local Customs office.\r\r\r                               Sincerely,\r\r\r\r\r                               John Durant, Director\r                               Commercial Rulings Division\r\u001A\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1993/953062.doc"",""id"":9119,""rulingNumber"":""953062"",""subject"":""Five Garlands"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1993-03-08T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""950999""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""9505.10.1500"",""9505.90.4000"",""6307.90.9986"",""5806.39.3020"",""5609.00.3000""]}"

After review of that ruling, Customs has determined that the classification for one of the two styles considered has changed from subheading 6115.92.9000, HTSUSA, as other stockings to subheading 6115.92.3000, HTSUSA, as surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  For the reasons that follow, this ruling modifies, in part, NY E82595.\r\rPursuant to section 625(c)(1) Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1625(c)(1)) as amended by section 623 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-82, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186), notice of the proposed modification of NY E82595 was published on January 8, 2003, in the Customs Bulletin, Volume 37, Number 2.  As explained in the notice, the period within which to submit comments on this proposal was until February 7, 2003.  No comments were received in response to this notice.\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe article under consideration is one style of compression hosiery, identified in NY E82595 as Style Cotton 162 (style 162).  Style 162 is thigh-high hosiery and comprised of 66 percent cotton, 17 percent polyamide and 17 percent elastane fabric, with a decitex of 486.  It features a covered heel, open toe and elastic band at the top.  Style 162 supplies graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg1 and is prescribed by a physician.  \r\rIn NY E82595, Customs classified style 162 in subheading 6115.92.9000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Other: Of cotton: Other: Other.\""  We note that at the time NY E82595 was issued we considered the following:  \r\rIt is Customs position that surgical compression hosiery, because of their construction and application of use, are more than simple compression stockings to treat varicose veins.  The hosiery is made of heavy gauge, opaque, elasticized knit fabric, and is designed to supply compression in the range of 30-40 mm mercury to 50-60 mercury.  They are prescribed by physicians for the treatment of venous diseases and other serious conditions such as reversible and irreversible lymphedema and severe post-thrombotic treatment.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper classification of the subject graduated compression hosiery under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.  Merchandise that cannot be classified in accordance with GRI 1 is to be classified in accordance with subsequent GRI taken in order.  The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN), constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the EN provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUSA and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.\r\rHeading 6115, HTSUSA, provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted.\""  \r\r\tIn HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, both dated January 2, 2002, Customs classified stockings with graduated compression ranging 20-30 mm Hg as surgical stockings for orthopedic treatment.  To reach our decision, we considered a study evaluating the effects of duration of use of class I (20-30 mm Hg) graduated compression hosiery.  See Robert Weiss, Neil Sadick, Mitchel Goldman, & Margaret Weiss, Post-Sclerotherapy Compression: Controlled Comparative Study of Duration of Compression and its Effects on Clinical Outcome DERMATOL SURG, 35: 105-108 (1999).  This study essentially persuaded our office that compression greater than 20 mm Hg is presently considered necessary for reduction of venous insufficiency.2 We noted certain statements made in the study, including \"" . . . in terms of controlling objective and subjective parameters of venous insufficiency no difference was found between class I (20-30 mm Hg) and class II (30-40 mm Hg) compression stockings.\""  Based on our review, we found that the study suggested that sclerotherapy results overall can be significantly improved by class I compression and should be part of the post-operative sclerotherapy protocol.  In citing other studies, the study concluded that class I (20-30 mm Hg) compression may be recommended over class II since patient compliance is much higher and symptom improvement is identical.  See Jungbeck C, Thulin I, Darenheim C, Norgen L.  Graduated Compression Treatment in Patients with Chronic Venous Insufficiency; A Study Comparing Low and Medium Grade Compression Stockings.  PHLEBOLOGIE, 12:142-5 (1997). \r\rMoreover, during our review of HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, this office examined several letters from vascular surgeons and dermatologists familiar with the beneficial effects of compression on the venous system.  The letters indicated consensus within the medical community that surgical stockings with graduated compression of 20-30 mm Hg are principally used for orthopedic purposes and are primarily prescribed by physicians to prevent or correct bodily deformities and the consequences associated with venous disease.  The letters established that it is widely recognized that 20 mm Hg of compression is considered necessary for the treatment of venous disease.  We noted in HQ 963517 and HQ 963518 that the physicians stated that they recommend using surgical supports with graduated compression of 20 to 30 mm Hg for several reasons: to prevent telangiectatic matting following sclerotherapy, to prevent thrombus formation and phlebitic reactions following sclerotherapy, to reduce post-operative edema, to prevent venous ulcerations, to prevent venous dermatitis and as treatment protocol for post-operative invasive vascular procedures.  \r\rIn HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, Customs determined that physicians generally recommend graduated compression therapy as a treatment for venous insufficiency.  We further recognized that graduated compression hosiery is generally available in three classes of compression; class I specifically covers a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg.  We found that physicians generally prescribe compression stockings and that doctors indicated that patients generally find the hosiery uncomfortable and do not <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them unless directed by a doctor.  Moreover, letters from medical authorities and conversations with medical professionals confirmed that certified and well-trained personnel must measure various parts of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and leg of a patient in order to obtain a proper fit for the stockings.  We also found that pharmacies and medical supply companies prefer that a patient have a prescription that prescribes the amount of compression and noted that stockings obtained by prescription are often covered by insurance.  We obseved that graduated compression stockings are significantly more expensive than support hosiery of the types generally found in retail stores, noting that panty hose with 20-30 mm Hg compression typically sell for approximately $75.00 to $100.00 and similar thigh-high stockings typically sell for $60.00 to $95.00 per pair.\r\rAccordingly, in HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, we concluded that surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg should be considered surgical hosiery with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment when prescribed by a physician and/or specially fitted to the patient.  \r\rAs the subject merchandise has a graduated compression range of 20-30 mm Hg and is prescribed by a physician, Customs finds the instant graduated compression hosiery is within the scope of subheading 6115.92.3000, HTSUSA, providing for surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\r\rHOLDING:\r\rBased on the foregoing, style 162 is classified under subheading 6115.92.3000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Other: Of cotton: Surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\"" The general column one rate of duty is \""Free.\"" \r\rNY E82595 is hereby MODIFIED, in part.  In accordance with 19 U.S.C. §1625(c), this ruling will become effective 60 days after its publication in the Customs Bulletin.\r\rSincerely,\r\r\r\rMyles B. Harmon, Director\rCommercial Rulings Division\r1 Compression is measured by how much pressure is required to elevate a column of Mercury (Hg) a certain distance, as measured in millimeters (mm).\r2  The partial failure of leg veins to carry blood up towards the heart results in venous disorders, which vary in severity from mild varicosity to deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.  The use of graduated compression stockings is one of the methods used in the prevention and treatment of these disorders.  The stockings are constructed so that the maximum pressure is exerted at the ankle and gradually decreasing up the leg, thus achieving a milking effect that helps blood rise toward the heart.  \r5\r\r\r\r2\r\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/2003/965920.doc"",""id"":20311,""rulingNumber"":""965920"",""subject"":""Modification of New York Ruling Letter E82595, dated June 11, 1999; Classification of Medical Graduated Compression Stockings"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""2003-02-12T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""E82595"",""963517"",""963518""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[""E82595""],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6115.92.3000""]}"

A sample of the Lumbarjack was submitted for our\rexamination and will be returned to you with this ruling.  In\raddition, you have provided us with product literature, a video,\ra survey performed by your company at the American Academy of\rOrthopedic Surgeons conference and three studies on your Back-Up\rproduct.  Moreover, on March 24, 1994, you met with my staff\rattorneys to discuss your position and to demonstrate the use of\rthe Lumbarjack.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The submitted article is called the Lumbarjack and it consists\rof a large belt and a long strap attached to each side of the belt. \rThe belt is 38 inches long and six inches wide with a firm but not\rrigid back pad measuring 13-1/2 inches long and an elastic pad with\rvelcro.  Each strap is two inches wide and has two adjustable\rbuckles.  The Lumbarjack also has two knee pouches formed by two\relastic bands measuring three inches wide each and a loop that goes\rover the wearer's <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>. \r\r     According to the information you provided, this product is\rdesigned to provide support and comfort for the lower back while\rdriving.  The Lumbarjack support system uses reverse pressure from\rthe knees to support the back while keeping the legs free for a\rfull range of inhibited motion.  In addition, this item converts\rto an adjustable support belt for lifting when the leg straps are\rdetached.\r\r\r     You stated that your first market for this item is persons in\rthe medical field.  You also sell it at trade shows, state fairs,\rthrough mail order and infomercials.  You do not sell it to\rretailers because this product needs to be demonstrated and\rretailers will not take the time to do this.\r\r     In HRL 955010 we held that the Lumbarjack was not classifiable\ras an orthopedic device in heading 9021, HTSUS, nor was it\rclassifiable as an automobile accessory in heading 8708, HTSUS. \rWe determined that the Lumbarjack was classified in subheading\r6307.90.9986, HTSUS, which provides for \""[o]ther made up articles,\rincluding dress patterns: [o]ther: [o]ther: [o]ther: [o]ther:\r[o]ther.\"" \r\r     In your submissions and in the meeting, you stated that it is\ryour position that the Lumbarjack is an orthopedic device and\rshould be classified in heading 9021, HTSUS.  In the alternative,\rthis article should be classified as an automobile accessory in\rheading 8708, HTSUS.  You presented three main arguments in support\rof your position:\r\r     1.   The Lumbarjack has a combination of adjustable straps,\r          buckles and elastic and webbing loops that makes it\r          distinguishable from ordinary corsets and belts.  The\r          combination of these features provides a unique        \rpressure transference system which combines the use of           \rboth the knees and back.  This system sets the product           \rapart from ordinary corsets and belts. \r\r     2.   The purpose of the elastic part of the Lumbarjack is to\r          allow the driver flexibility and mobility and in no way\r          contributes to the effectiveness of the product in\r          providing back support.  Therefore, this item should   \r     not be excluded from heading 9021, HTSUS, based on          \rLegal Note 1(b) to Chapter 90, HTSUS.\r\r     3.   The Lumbarjack should be considered an automobile\r          accessory for the purposes of heading 8708, HTSUS, as  \r     it is exclusively designed for driving and it should        \rnot make any difference whether it is attached to the       car or\rthe driver. \r\r     In attempting to demonstrate that this item is an orthopedic\rdevice, you also provided us with the results of a survey conducted\rby your company at the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons\r(AAOS) conference in February 1994.  You also point out that,\rbefore marketing your products, the FDA has required you to\rregister your products with them as orthopedic orthoses and comply\rwith their labeling requirements.  Moreover, your trademark rights\rfor this product have been registered in a class providing for\rorthopedic devices. \r\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Whether the Lumbarjack support is classifiable as an\rorthopedic device in heading 9021, HTSUS, or as an accessory to a\rmotor vehicle in heading 8708, HTSUS, or as an other made up\rarticle in heading 6307, HTSUS?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Heading 9021, HTSUS, provides for orthopedic appliances and\rother appliances which are worn or carried, or implanted in the\rbody to compensate for a defect or disability.  The Harmonized \rCommodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) to\rHeading 9021 state that orthopedic appliances are for:\r\r     (i)  Preventing or correcting body deformities; or\r     (ii) Supporting or holding organs following an illness or\r          operation.\r\rThey include:\r     \r     (11) Appliances for correcting scoliosis and curvature of   \r     the spine as well as all medical or surgical corsets        \rand belts (including certain supporting belts)         \rcharacterized by:\r\r          (a)  Special pads, springs, etc., adjustable to fit the\r               patient\r\r          (b)  The materials of which they are made (leather, \r               metal, plastics, etc.); or\r\r          (c)  The presence of reinforced parts, rigid pieces of\r               fabric or bands of various widths. \r\r               The special design of these articles for a\r          particular orthopaedic purpose distinguishes them from\r          ordinary corsets and belts, whether or not the latter\r          also serve to support or hold. \r \r     Although the instant merchandise may offer relief for many\rback related problems and may be recommended by orthopedists and\rphysical therapists, this item does not constitute an orthopedic\rappliance for tariff purposes.  The information that we have\rindicates that it (1) provides support and comfort for the lower\rback while driving; (2) alleviates backache and strain; and (3)\reliminates fatigue.  Furthermore, it is clear that the item does\rnot have the support mechanisms, i.e., metal reinforcements,\radjustable springs and rigid parts, that distinguish the items \r\r\r\rcontemplated by the above ENs to heading 9021 from other articles\rthat may have medical uses.  We note that the items classified in\rHRL 556580, dated June 29, 1992, were more specialized in terms of\rtheir design and adjustability than the Lumberjack.  For example,\rthe hernia belt was used by individuals who have suffered from an\ringuinal rupture.  Inguinal trusses are one of the exemplars in the\rENs for 9021, HTSUS.  While the sacro-iliac belt was used to help\rrelieve lower back pain and spasm, provide support and could be\rused as a posture aid, the many adjusting devices on the product\rdistinguished it from an ordinary belt and made it akin to items\rlike corset trusses with various special features.  Therefore, it\ris our position that, while the Lumbarjack does have features that\rmake it adjustable for the wearer, we do not believe that the\rfeatures present are sufficient to make it an orthopedic appliance. \rThus, it is not akin to the exemplars cited in the ENs and is not\rof the same class or kind as the orthopedic appliances covered by\rthis provision.  \r\r     Furthermore, it is our position that the item may at best be\rhelpful in alleviating muscle spasms and back pain; however, there\ris no indication that it will prevent or correct any deformities\rthat may result from back related problems, nor is there any\revidence that it is used to hold or support organs following an\rillness or operation.  While you have presented responses from a\rsurvey conducted at the AAOS conference to demonstrate that the\rLumbarjack could be used for orthopedic purposes, we do not believe\rthat this qualifies the Lumbarjack as an orthopedic device.  First,\rwe note that the Lumbarjack was not the only product that was the\rsubject of the survey.  Therefore, it is possible that some of the\rpositive answers to the first three questions, which dealt with the\rENs discussion of the term \""orthopedic\"", could have been directed\rmore toward one product than another.  Second, as we have stated\rbefore in HRL 081639, dated August 25, 1989, the fact that doctors\rmay be using an item for medical purposes does not mean that it\rmeets the guidelines set forth for orthopedic appliances. \rMoreover, we also stated that the fact that a product is aimed at\ra medical market does not necessarily establish the medical nature\rof the product for tariff purposes.      \r\r     As we stated in HRL 955010, these items are akin to lumbar\rsupport belts that we have classified in heading 6307, HTSUS.  For\rexample in HRL 952841, dated January 26, 1993, we classified the\r\""Bolen Work Rite Back Support System\"" in heading 6307, HTSUS.  This\rarticle measured 35 inches by 9 inches at its widest point and\rtapered to four inches at either end.  The middle section consisted\rof heavy elastic knit fabric with four vertical stays.  Each end\rsection had a vertical stay made from cellular foam \r\r\r\rlaminated on the outer surface with hook and loop fabric, and on\rthe inner surface with knit man-made fabrics.  A large rectangular\rtab of hook and loop fabric was sewn to one end and used to secure\rthe belt.  It also had two elastic fabric outer bands each of which\rwas sewn at one end to the rear center.  The narrow bands extended\raround either side and with the use of hook and loop end tabs,\rprovided additional tension adjustment for the wearer.  It also had\rpermanently attached adjustable and elasticized suspenders.  The\rback support delivered firm and comfortable support to the lower\rback and it promoted proper posture during lifting, standing and\rbending.  While this belt did not use the knee and back combination\rin providing relief to the wearer, it has similar mechanisms for\radjustments and its use is akin to the that of the Lumbarjack.  See\ralso, HRL 952829, dated February 19, 1993 and HRL 952201, dated\rOctober 26, 1992, which classified similar articles in subheading\r6307.90.9986, HTSUS.\r\r     It also remains our position that the Lumbarjack is not an\rautomobile accessory classifiable in heading 8708, HTSUS.  While\ryou maintain that the item is exclusively designed for driving,\rthe product literature tells us that it can be used with the leg\rstraps for driving and without the legs straps for lifting. \rTherefore, these articles are not necessarily identifiable as being\rsuitable for use solely or principally with automobiles.  \rFurthermore, the effectiveness of this article is applied directly\rto the wearer, not the vehicle.  Although the comfort and health\rof the driver might be enhanced by wearing this while driving, it\ris still a personal article of <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  The product is obviously not\rdesigned or intended to complement the operation of the vehicle. \rThe Lumbarjack was designed with a person in a vehicle in mind, not\rthe vehicle itself. \r\r      Finally, in your submission you stated that the FDA has\rrequired you to register your products with them as \""orthopedic\rorthoses\"".  Our classification of an article as being used for\rorthopedic purposes is not dependent upon or in any way related to\rthat of the FDA or any other government agency.  See, Marine\rProducts Co. v. United States, 42 Cust. Ct. 154, 155, C.D. 2080\r(1959), (which states that \""[c]haracterization of imported\rmerchandise by governmental agencies for other than tariff purposes\rdoes not determine tariff classification\"".)  Moreover, in  HRL\r086139, we stated the following: \"" ...proof of Food and Drug\rregistration is not a governing factor in Customs classification\rof orthopedic appliances.  The Customs Service operates under\rdifferent laws than those under which the Food and Drug rulings are\rissued.  Interpretations under laws other than those relating to\rtariff classification are not determinative of Customs\rclassification disputes.\""\r\r\r\r\rHOLDING:\r\r      HRL 955010 is affirmed.  The Lumbarjack support is\rclassifiable in subheading 6307.90.9986, HTSUS.

This result will be achieved by raising the\r          navigation bridge some fourteen (14) feet, and by\r          modifying some of the hatches between numbers seven (7)\r          and eleven (11) in order that they might accomodate\r          containers of forty-five (45) feet.\r          ...\r          In its application of the vessel repair statute, the\r          Customs Service has held that modifications, alterations,\r          or additions to the hull and fittings of a vessel are not\r          subject to vessel repair duties.  The identification of\r          work constituting modifications vis-a-vis work\r          constituting repairs has evolved from judicial and\r          administrative precedent.  In considering whether an\r          operation has resulted in a nondutiable modification, the\r          following factors have been considered:\r\r               1.   Whether there is a permanent incorporation into\r               the  hull or superstructure of a vessel (See United\r               States v. Admiral Oriental Line, 18 C.C.P.A. 137  \r               (1930)), either in a structural sense or as       \r               demonstrated by means of attachment so as to be\r               indicative of the intent to be permanently\r               incorporated.  \r\r               2.   Whether in all likelihood an item under\r               consideration would remain aboard a vessel during\ran             extended lay-up.\r\r               \r\r                              - 3 -\r\r               3.   Whether, if not a first time installation, an\r               item under consideration constitutes a new design\r               feature and does not merely replace a part, fitting,\r               or structure that is performing a similar function.\r\r               4.   Whether an item under consideration provides\ran             improvement or enhancement in operation or\r               efficiency of the vessel.\r\r          With specific reference to the items presently under\r          consideration, there would appear to be every likelihood\r          that an examination of the invoices detailing the work\r          outlined above would result in a finding that the vessels\r          had undergone non-dutiable modifications in a foreign\r          shipyard.  The operations anticipated to be completed\r          abroad are of the type which we have previously found to\r          be modifications rather than repairs.\r\r     The applicant has broken certain of the work performed into\rsix modifications which it has numbered M1 through M6.  You have\rasked us to review the following items on the applicant's\rworksheet:  M1 - 1, 255, 275, 281, 282, 283; M2 - 2; M3 - 3, 284;\rM4 - 145, 146, 147; M5 - 190, 191, 192; and M6 - 204, 205, 206. \r\r     The applicant states the following:\r\r     M1.  These items relate to a structural modification of the\rvessel which increased the height of the wheelhouse to allow the\rvessel to carry more cargo while it still complied with visibility\rrequirements.  Additional structural changes were made as a result\rof the bridge raising.  The foremast was modified to meet\rvisibility requirements.  The mounting of the navigation lights was\rmodified to conform with U.S. Coast Guard requirements.  The diesel\rgenerator exhaust stack was raised to prevent exhaust gases from\rbeing pulled into the wheelhouse.\r\r     M2.  This item relates to the modification of hatch numbers\rseven, nine, and 11 to carry 45 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> containers, which the vessel\rhas the capacity to carry as a result of the modification.\r\r     M3.  These items relate to the modification of the cover to\rhatch number one to permit the double-lashing of containers.\r\r     M4.  These items relate to the modification of cell guide\rgathers, which provide entry targets for the crane operator when\rcontainers are stowed below deck.  A new structural fitting was\rinstalled between the cell guide gather and the hatch coaming to\rprevent future damage.\r\r     \r\r\r\r                              - 4 -\r\r     M5.  These items relate to the modification of hatch cover\rliners for hatch numbers four and 11.  The previous liners were\rcomposed of mild steel and were subject to frequent damage due to\rcorrosion and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  The new liners are stainless steel.\r\r     M6.  These items relate to the modification of hatch covers\rat hatch numbers 13 and 4S.  The hatch covers were fitted with deck\rsockets which provide a tie point for a container locking device. \rPrior to this modification, attempts to use these sockets\roccasionally resulted in damage to the cover as it deflected\rexcessively if the locking device missed the socket.\r\r     Based on the evidence of record in the case file, we find that\rall of the above items are nondutiable modifications with the\rexception of the following items: 145, 146, 147, and 283.  \r\r     We find that items 145, 146, and 147 are dutiable repairs\rbased on the invoice for items 143-147 which indicates that the\rwork is both a modification and a repair.  That invoice describes\rthe modification, but also states \""Labor - repair cell guides\"" with\rrespect to item 146.  Based on the apparent contradiction on the\rface of the invoice, we are unable to conclude that items 145, 146,\rand 147 are for work which constitutes nondutiable modification. \rWe conclude that these three items are for work which constitutes\rdutiable repairs.\r\r     With respect to item 283, which is within the M1 group, we\rfind that the invoice does not reflect a sufficient nexus with the\rM1 modification work.  The invoice states in part: \""furnish\rjunction boxes...furnish 60' transducer cables...furnish MCFQ-\r2518A-50 meter sat-com cables.\""  The invoice does not establish\rthat these expenses are related to a nondutiable modification. \rAccordingly, we find that this item is a dutiable repair.        \r\rIssue (2)\r\r     You have asked us to review the following items which the\rapplicant has termed on its worksheet \""Intrinsic part of an\rinspection required by USCG and ABS\"":  34, 36, 47, 48, 53, 54, 56,\r61, 64, 67, 73, 79, 131, and 229.  \r\r     The evidence of record indicates that the the work performed\rwith respect to these items was pursuant to inspections required\rby the U.S. Coast Guard and ABS.  We have consistently held that\ra survey undertaken to meet the requirements of a governmental\rentity, classification society, or insurance carrier is not\rdutiable.  Accordingly, all of these items are not dutiable.\r\rIssue (3)\r\r     You have asked us to review the following items which the\rapplicant has termed on its worksheet \""Clerical and administrative \r\r                              - 5 -\r\rcosts, non-productive work, non-dutiable\"": 76, 85, 89, 95, 101,\r105, 111, 116, 122, 126, 137, 152, 156, 160, 163, 171, 175, 179,\r183, 186, 196, 199, 202, 208, 212, 216, 219, 222, 226, 232, 236,\r240, 244, 248, and 253.\r\r     The invoices reflect that these items constituted\radministrative costs, administrative charges, or administrative\roverhead.  We find that all of these items are dutiable because the\rrecord indicates that these administrative costs were related to\rdutiable repairs.\r\rIssue (4)\r\r     You have asked us to review item 258, which the applicant has\rtermed on its worksheet: \""Cleaning, no repairs or painting, non-\rdutiable.\""\r\r     The invoice for this item indicates that the cleaning was not\rrelated to a repair.  Accordingly, we find that this item is\rnondutiable.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The application for relief is allowed in part and denied in\rpart.

Ocean Blvd.\rLong Beach CA\r\rAttn: \tCrystal Morgan, Supervisory Import Specialist\r\rRe: \tApplication for Further Review of Protest No. 2704-19-102962; Classification of Women’s Footwear\r\rDear Port Director:\r\r\tThis is in reference to the Application for Further Review (“AFR”) of Protest No. 2704-19-102962, received on April 12, 2019, on behalf of Shoes West Inc. (“Protestant”), regarding U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (“CBP”) tariff classification of certain women’s footwear under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”).  In addition to the written submission, our decision below takes into consideration a telephone conference with Protestant’s counsel on December 1, 2020.\r\rFACTS:\r\r\tThe merchandise at issue is a style of women’s shoes, identified as style no. MST-13482A or “Moc Star.”  The shoes are below-the-ankle sneakers with a lace-up closure, a textile upper with a separately-attached tongue, a padded collar, heel counter, a foxing or foxing-like band, and a general athletic appearance.  Pictures provided by Protestant show a rubber or plastics outer sole with traction provided by the raised letters of the company’s brand “täos” in a repeating pattern that covers the entire external surface that touches the ground and small grooves along the edge of the outer sole.  According to marketing materials, the cushioned removable footbed provides balance, stability, arch support, heel support, and metatarsal support.  \r\rThe subject merchandise was entered on December 21, 2018 under subheading 6404.19.90, HTSUS, which provides for “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: Other: Other: Valued over $12/pair.”  The merchandise was liquidated on March 15, 2019 and re-liquidated on March 22, 2019 under subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUS, which provides for “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like: Other: Valued over $12/pair.”\r\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhat is the tariff classification of the women’s footwear under the HTSUS?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tInitially, we note that the matter protested is protestable under 19 U.S.C. § 1514(a)(2) as a decision on classification.  The protest was timely filed within 180 days of liquidation.  (Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2004, Pub. L. 108-429, § 2103(2)(B)(ii), (iii) (codified as amended at 19 U.S.C. § 1514(c)(3) (2006)).  Further Review of Protest No. 2704-19-102962 is properly accorded to Protestant pursuant to 19 C.F.R. § 174.24(b) because the decision against which the protest was filed is alleged to involve questions of law or fact which have not been ruled upon by the Commissioner of CBP or his designee or by the Customs courts.\r\r\tClassification under the HTSUS is determined in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (“GRI”).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI may then be applied.\r\r\tThe 2018 HTSUS provisions under consideration are as follows:\r\r6404:\tFootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\rFootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics:\r6404.11:\tSports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like:\r\t\t\tOther:\r6404.11.90:\t\t\t\tValued over $12/pair: (20%)\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r6404.19:\t\tOther: \rOther:\r6404.19.90:\t\t\t\tValued over $12/pair: (9%)\r\t\t\t\t\t \r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\rAdditional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64, HTSUS, provides as follows:\r\rFor the purposes of this chapter, the term “tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like” covers athletic footwear other than sports footwear (as defined in subheading note 1 above), whether or not principally used for such athletic games or purposes.\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\rTreasury Decision (“T.D.”) 93-88, which provides “Footwear Definitions,” states, in pertinent part, that “athletic” footwear includes:\r\r“Athletic” footwear (sports footwear included in this context) includes:\r\r1. \tShoes usable only in the serious pursuit of a particular sport, which have or have provision for attachment of spikes, cleats, clips or the like. \r2.  \tSki, wrestling & boxing boots; cycling shoes; and skating boots w/o skates attached.\r3. \tTennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes (sneakers), training shoes (joggers) and the like whether or not principally used for such athletic games or purposes. \r\rIt does not include:\r\rShoes that resemble sport shoes but clearly could not be used at all in that sporting activity.  Examples include sneakers with a sequined or extensively embroidered uppers.\rA “slip-on”, except gymnastic slippers.\rSkate boots with ice or roller skates attached.\r\rFootwear Definitions, Treas. Dec. 93-88, 27 Cust. B. & Dec. No. 46 (Oct. 25, 1993).\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\rIn its submission, Protestant argues that the subject footwear is not “athletic” footwear described by the clause “tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like” in the text of subheading 6404.11, HTSUS.  Although the Protestant concedes that the shoe has some features considered athletic, it argues that the majority of the features are routinely found in footwear that is not athletic.  Specifically, Protestant contends that: (1) the shoe is not particularly flexible; (2) the outer sole does not have an athletic tread; (3) the shoe lacks a padded tongue, anti-injury devices, and toe bumpers, (4) the collar has minimal padding; (5) the heel counter is soft and pliable; and (6)\u00A0the shoe has a fully collapsible upper and a moccasin-type toe.  Furthermore, Protestant notes that the shoe’s purpose is comfort and it is not marketed for athletic activity. \r\rThe dispute is at the six-digit level of classification.  The footwear is described by the terms of heading 6404, HTSUS, which provides for “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials.”  At issue here is whether the footwear under consideration is “athletic” footwear within the meaning of Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64, HTSUS, and classified in subheading 6404.11, HTSUS, as “tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like,” or whether the footwear is classified in subheading 6404.19, HTSUS, as “other” footwear.\r\rSubheading 6404.11, HTSUS, provides for “tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like.”  The principle of ejusdem generis applies to provisions containing the phrase “and the like.”  In an ejusdem generis analysis, “where an enumeration of specific things is followed by a general word or phrase, the general word or phrase is held to refer to things of the same kind as those specified.”  Deckers Corp. v. United States, 752 F.3d 949, 952 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2014)(“Deckers II”) (citing Sports Graphics, Inc. v. United States, 24 F.3d 1390, 1392 (Fed. Cir. 1994)).  In Deckers Corp. v. United States (“Deckers I”), 532 F.3d 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2008), aff’d, Deckers II, 752 F.3d 949, on the issue of whether Teva Sport Sandals were classified in subheading 6404.11 as “athletic footwear,” the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated that to determine the essential characteristic of the specified enumerated articles, “courts may consider attributes such as the purpose, character, material, design, and texture.”  Deckers I, 532 F.3d at 1316.  In regard to the particular exemplars of heading 6404.11, HTSUS, the court determined that “the fundamental feature that the exemplars share is the design, specifically the enclosed upper, which contains features that stabilize the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, and protect against abrasion and impact.”  Id. at 1317.  \r\rAdditional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64 states that athletic footwear is classified in subheading 6404.11, HTSUS, “whether or not principally used for such athletic games or purposes.”  CBP has interpreted this Note to mean that shoes need not be used solely for athletic purposes, but also those shoes that share appearance, qualities, and character with the named exemplars are classified there.  See Headquarters Ruling Letter (“HQ”) H236274 (Sept. 17, 2015) (classifying “athleisure” shoes as athletic); and HQ 953882 (Sept. 24, 1993) (holding that hiking boots were not “like” the exemplars).  Thus, a shoe may be designed for casual use and still be classified as athletic footwear.  \r\rIt is CBP’s position that for footwear to be classified as athletic footwear under subheading 6404.11, HTSUS, it must be suitable for an activity that requires fast footwork or extensive running.  See HQ 964625 (Sept. 10, 2001) (“All the exemplars are used in sports which require fast footwork or extensive running.”); and NY N154085 (Apr. 4, 2011).  Thus, when determining whether footwear is classified as athletic footwear under subheading 6404.11, HTSUS, CBP looks at various features and characteristics including, but not limited to, overall appearance, materials, and construction of the upper and outer sole.  Some of the features or characteristics of athletic footwear CBP has consistently included are: a lightweight upper, a lightweight, flexible outer sole that provides traction, lace-up, or some other type of secure closure, underfoot cushioning, collar (padded or not), tongue (padded or not), toe bumpers, heel counters/stabilizers, and ventilation holes.  See HQ H265479 (Mar. 28, 2016); NY N310350 (Mar. 26, 2020); NY N020906 (Jan. 9, 2008); and NY M82301 (May 26, 2006).  However, athletic footwear need not exhibit all of these features.  See NY N218203 (June 6, 2012); and NY N154085 (Apr. 4, 2011).  \r\rWe disagree with the Protestant’s assertion that the outer sole does not have the flexibility and tread requisite of athletic footwear.  Photos of the sample show that the sole is flexible enough to easily fold the footwear in half.  Additionally, the Taos website states that the Moc Star’s outsole consists of “Flexible, durable rubber.”  Taos, https://taosfootwear.com/view-all/moc-star (last visited Dec. 1, 2020).  We also find that the footwear’s outer sole tread, which consists of the company’s logo “täos” patterned across the entire external surface, provides traction on smooth and unsmooth surfaces.  The outer sole also has grooves along the outer edge, providing further traction and allowing the wearer to engage in fast footwork.  An online retailer of the subject footwear, Zappos.com, demonstrates the flexibility of the shoe in a promotional video and states that the “Durable rubber outsole provides excellent traction and a long-lasting <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.”  Zappos.com, https://www.zappos.com/product/8998551/ (last visited Dec. 1, 2020).  We also find that the subject footwear has features that protect the wearer from injury such as the removable padded insole, which is shock absorbent and provides heel support, arch support, and metatarsal support.  Furthermore, the Protestant asserts that the shoe is marketed as casual, comfortable shoes and not as athletic footwear, although the Taos website categorizes the Moc Star shoes as “Active” sneakers, implying that they are capable of dynamic physical activity.  Taos, https://taosfootwear.com/active (last visited Dec. 1, 2020).\u0002  Regardless of whether or not the shoes are marketed as athletic footwear, the determinative issue is whether the subject Moc Star shoe shares physical characteristics with the exemplars of subheading 6404.11, HTSUS, as “athletic footwear.”  See, e.g., NY N031799 (July 15, 2008) (classifying canvas sneakers that were marketed as casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> fashion shoes in subheading 6404.11.9050, HTSUS, based on their athletic features).\r\r\tThe Moc Star shoe at issue is similar to the one in HQ H236274, dated September 17, 2015, wherein CBP classified a men’s sneaker identified as Keds® “The Champion” in subheading 6404.11.89, HTSUS.  Like the footwear at issue, the shoe in HQ H236274 was a below-the-ankle lace-up sneaker with a textile upper, a rubber or plastics outer sole, with a foxing or foxing-like band, and a general athletic appearance.  The rubber outsole provided traction and was lightweight and flexible.  The importer submitted that the shoe lacked arch support, shock absorbers, toe bumpers, padding around the heel, ankle, and tongue, underfoot cushioning, and significant traction on the sole.  Nevertheless, CBP determined that the shoe shared physical characteristics and attributes with the exemplars of subheading 6404.11, HTSUS.  \r\rUpon review and examination of the materials provided, we conclude that the footwear has the general appearance and many of the construction features present in athletic footwear.  In particular, the shoe has a lightweight, flexible upper that is secured to a flexible, rubber outsole with a foxing or foxing-like band.  It has a lace-front closure with a tongue that secures the footwear to the wearer, enabling the wearer to engage in fast footwork.  The shoe also has underfoot cushioning with support features, a padded collar, heel counter, and a traction outer sole.  The Moc Star footwear possesses all the attributes that CBP considers characteristic of the exemplars named in Additional U.S. Note 2, above, and are therefore “like” those exemplars.  Accordingly, we find that the footwear at issue is classified in subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUS, which provides for “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like: Other: Valued over $12/pair.”  \r\rHOLDING:\r\rBy application of GRI 1, the subject women’s shoes are classified under heading 6404, HTSUS, specifically under subheading 6404.11.9050, HTSUS, which provides for “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like: Other: Valued over $12/pair: For women: Other.”  The 2018 column one, general rate of duty is 20% ad valorem.\r\rYou are instructed to DENY the protest.\r\rIn accordance with Sections IV and VI of the CBP Protest/Petition Processing Handbook (HB 3500-08A, December 2007, pp. 24 and 26), you are to mail this decision, together with the CBP Form 19, to the Protestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter.  Any re-liquidation of the entry or entries in accordance with the decision must be accomplished prior to mailing the decision.\r\rSixty days from the date of the decision, the Office of Trade, Regulations and Rulings will make the decision available to CBP personnel, and to the public on the Customs Rulings Online Search System (“CROSS”) at https://rulings.cbp.gov/ which can be found on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website at http://www.cbp.gov and other methods of public distribution.\r\rSincerely,\r\r\r\r     For Craig T.

Box 3165\rHarrisburg, PA 17105\r\rRE:\tThe tariff classification of an iPod Value Pack from China\r\rDear Ms. Aldinger:\r\r\tIn your letter dated March 26, 2007, you requested a tariff classification ruling.\r\r\tThe merchandise subject to this ruling is an iPod Value Pack.  It is referenced on the packaging as vendor Item #A17O0021.  However, you explained in a telephone conversation with this office that, Rite Aid refers to the item, as they have in their ruling request, as an iPod Video 5in1 Bundle Pack, Rite Aid Item #95176.\r\rA sample of the iPod Value Pack was furnished with your letter.  The iPod Value Pack consists of the following five items: 1 - a USB power adaptor, 2 - a USB car adaptor, 3 - an iPod audio splitter, 4 - a USB cable, and 5 - a silicon iPod video case.  The iPod Value Pack sample will be returned as per your request.  \r\rThe USB power adaptor has an alternating current (AC) plug on one side that is plugged into an AC outlet and USB port on the other side into which an iPod connector cord is plugged into.  The USB power adaptor converts AC energy into direct current (DC) energy to provide power to an iPod.\r\rThe USB car adapter is a direct current to direct current (DC-to-DC) device that plugs into a car cigarette lighter and into an iPod to provide power to the iPod and charge the battery within the iPod, as well.  This DC-to-DC car charger allows an input of DC 12 volt to 24 volts and provides an output of DC 5 volts (500mA).\r\rThe iPod audio splitter is a small device that has a single cylindrical contact connector on one end and two cylindrical multi-contact connector ports on the other.  This device allows the user to use two sets of audio ear bud/headsets at the same time to listen to music from the same iPod.\r\rThe USB cable is an approximately four <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> length of insulated cable with a USB connector on one end and an “iPod dock connector” on the other end.  This cable is used to connect an iPod to the USB port of a personal computer for the transfer of data, as well as for charging the iPod battery.  The cable is also used to connect the iPod to the included USB power adaptor and USB car adaptor.\r\rThe silicon iPod video case is a holder for an iPod.  It has a belt loop opening in the back for a belt to go through so that a person can <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> the iPod while being held in the silicon case.  It is wholly of non-rigid, molded silicon plastics.  iPod cases are designed and used to provide the useful functions of storage, protection, and organization for the device.\r\r\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0In determining the classification of the iPod value kit, we are guided by General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 3 in determining its classification because the items within the iPod Value Pack are classifiable under four separate headings.  GRI 3 (a) states that the heading, which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description.  We do not find that any one heading is more specific among the four under consideration.  Each heading is equally specific and merit equal consideration.  As a result, we make reference to GRI 3 (b) which, in part states, goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or components which gives them their essential character.  However, in this instance, we believe that the iPod Value Pack does not meet the Explanatory Notes (ENs) definition of \""goods put up in sets for retail sale\"".  Because, although the iPod Value Pack consists of at least two different articles that are, prima facie, classifiable in at least two different headings, the items within the iPod Value Pack are not put up together to carry out one activity.  Since the components do not contribute to one specific activity, the iPod Value Pack does not qualify as \""goods put up in sets for retail sale.\""  Therefore, each of the components within the iPod Value Pack will be classified separately under their respective headings.  As such, the USB power adaptor, the USB car adaptor, the iPod audio splitter, the USB cable, and the iPod video silicon case are classified separately.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the USB power adaptor will be 8504.40.95, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for “Electrical transformers, static converters (for example, rectifiers) and inductors; parts thereof: Static converters: Other: Rectifiers and rectifying apparatus.”  The rate of duty will be 1.5 percent ad valorem.\r\rThe applicable subheading for the USB car adapter will be 8504.40.9580, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for “Electrical transformers, static converters (for example, rectifiers) and inductors; parts thereof: Static converters: Other: Other.”  The rate of duty will be 1.5 percent ad valorem.\r\rThe applicable subheading for the an iPod audio splitter will be 8536.69.4050, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for “Coaxial connectors; cylindrical multicontact connectors; racks and panel connectors; printed circuit connectors; ribbon or flat cable connectors: Other.”  The rate of duty will be free.\r\rThe applicable subheading for the USB cable will be 8544.42.9000, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for “Other electric conductors, for a voltage not exceeding 1,000 V: Fitted with connectors: Other: Other.”  The rate of duty will be 2.6 percent ad valorem.\r\rThe applicable subheading for the silicon iPod video case will be 4202.99.9000, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides, in part, for “Other containers and cases: Other: Other: Other.”  The rate of duty will be 20.0 percent ad valorem.\r\r\tDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.  The text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on World Wide Web at http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/.\r\t\rThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\rA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

Both shoes also have inner linings, tongues and fully functional shoelace closures.  One shoe has a predominately leather upper with narrow textile material stripes at the sides and at the back.  The other shoe has an upper consisting of stitched together external surface area component parts that are of both textile and of rubber/plastic materials.  Note 3(a) to Chapter 64, HTSUS, provides that for the purposes of this chapter, the terms “rubber” and “plastics” include woven fabrics or other textile products with an external layer of rubber or plastics being visible to the naked eye. We note that the external surface area of this shoe’s upper (ESAU) includes a large percentage of textile material with a visible layer of rubber or plastics.  We are not able to determine whether textile or rubber/plastic is the greater constituent external surface area upper material on this shoe.\r\r\tWe also note that the submitted leather upper, rubber soled shoe is the type of footwear that is commonly worn by both sexes.  Since no indication is provided in your letter that any comparable styles of this shoe are offered for women, this shoe is considered “unisex” in sizes up to and including American men’s size 8.\r\r\tThe two other submitted sample items, which you identify only as “TPR bones,” one white and the other red in color, are parts of footwear, which are like removable insoles.  These two items can be described as <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> length slipper-like removable shoe insert, complete with molded and formed plastic toe and heel enclosures.  The shoe inserts or “bones” are made essentially of semi-rigid, molded thermoplastic (TPR) materials with a cemented-in layer of foam rubber/plastic cushioning covered by a thin textile layer of underfoot facing.  They are made to fit inside the “Skins-2-1” shoes, which you state, cannot be worn without them.  You also state that these “bones” or plastic inserts will always be imported separately.  The “bones” will be shipped and then sold separately, permitting the consumer to purchase multiple shoe shell “Skins” and to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them with any single pair of inserts or “bones.”  Although the “bones” and the “Skins” are intended to be worn together as a single unit of footwear, you clearly assert in your letter that these two different footwear items will not be put up and offered together as a single unit for retail sale.  This stated fact excludes the combination of the submitted footwear sample items from being considered a composite good or a set for classification purposes.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the leather upper shoe, identified as sample ”Patter #Skins2-1,” in American men’s size 8.5 and larger, will be 6403.99.60, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for footwear, with uppers predominately of leather and outer soles of rubber, plastics or composition leather; which is not “sports footwear”; which does not cover the ankle; for men, youths and boys.  The rate of duty will be 8.5% ad valorem.  In sizes up to and including American men’s size 8, the applicable subheading will be 6403.99.90, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with upper’s predominately of leather and outer soles of rubber, plastics or composition leather; which does not cover the ankle; which is valued over $2.50 per pair; for other persons.  The rate of duty will be 10% ad valorem.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the two shoe inserts, identified as “TPR bones,” will be 6406.99.3060, HTSUS, which provides for parts of footwear, which are removable insoles or heel cushions and similar articles, and which are essentially of rubber or plastics.  The rate of duty will be 5.3% ad valorem.\r\r\tDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change. The text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on World Wide Web at http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/.\r\r\tWe note that none of the four submitted footwear items are marked with the country of origin.  Therefore, if imported as is, the shoes and the shoe “bones” will not meet the country of origin marking requirement of 19 U.S.C. 1304.  Accordingly, the shoes and the two insole-like inserts will be considered not legally marked under the provisions of 19 C.F.R. 134.11 which states, “every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit.”\r\r\tYour inquiry does not provide enough information for us to give a classification ruling on the sample shoe, also identified as “Patter #Skins-2-1,” but which has an upper that is of both rubber/plastics and textile materials.  Your request for a classification ruling for this shoe should include an accurate (laboratory) external surface area upper (ESAU) material percentage measurement.  The removable shoelace and the shoe’s textile tongue are not included in the upper’s surface area material measurements.  When this information is available, you may wish to consider resubmission of your request.  We are returning any related samples, exhibits, etc. If you decide to resubmit your request, please include all of the material that we have returned to you.\r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

Box 1066\r40 Miramar Drive, Ste 12\rChamplain, NY 12919\r\rRE:\tThe tariff classification and status under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), of footwear from Canada; Article 509\r\rDear Ms. Rasco:\r\r\tIn your letter dated January 30, 2007, on behalf of Stonz <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Wear</span> Inc., you requested a ruling on the status of footwear from Canada under the NAFTA.\r\r\tThe submitted sample is described by you as a textile fleece lined, nylon textile material upper “baby bootie” with a sewn-on soft, waterproof PVC plastic coated polyester sole designed specially “to be easy to put on, stay on and keep babies feet warm and dry.”  The “Stonz” baby bootie, which has the shape of a tubular bag, can be a tightened for fit around the shape of an infant’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by two elasticized cords with plastic cordlocks, one attached to the side of the upper at ankle height and the other laced around the boot’s open topline.  The “bootie” does not have any special padding or foam insulation, other than a thin man-made textile fleece lining, nor is it waterproof, so it will not be considered protective against water, or cold or inclement weather.  You state that the footwear will be valued at over $12 per pair.\r\r\tThe applicable tariff provision for the “Stonz” baby bootie will be 6404.19.9090, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for footwear, in which the upper’s external surface is predominately textile materials; in which the outer soles external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not “athletic footwear”; which is not designed to be a protection against water, oil, or cold or inclement weather; which is not a slip-on; and which is valued over $12 per pair.  The general rate of duty will be 9% ad valorem.\r\r\tDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.  The text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on World Wide Web at http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/.\r\r\tIn your letter you state that this “baby bootie” will be made in Canada.  The fleece lining with PVC-coated polyester sole attached is made in China and imported into Canada.  The lining will then be sewn to a nylon upper, which is cut, eyeleted, appliquéd and labeled by sewers in Canada.  The finishing hardware (shock, cord, cordlocks and zip pulls) will also be attached in Canada.  The cost of the of the parts made in China, you state, will not be more than 17% of the total cost, making the regional content of the finished product at least 83%.\r\r\tGeneral Note 12(b), HTSUS, sets forth the criteria for determining whether a good is originating under the NAFTA.  General Note 12(b), HTSUS, (19 U.S.C. § 1202) states, in pertinent part, that\r\rFor the purposes of this note, goods imported into the customs territory of the United States are eligible for the tariff treatment and quantitative limitations set forth in the tariff schedule as \""goods originating in the territory of a NAFTA party\"" only if--\r\r(i) they are goods wholly obtained or produced entirely in the territory of Canada, Mexico and/or the United States; or\r\r(ii) they have been transformed in the territory of Canada, Mexico and/or the United States so that--\r\r(A) except as provided in subdivision (f) of this note, each of the non-originating materials used in the production of such goods undergoes a change in tariff classification described in subdivisions (r), (s) and (t) of this note or the rules set forth therein, or\r\r(B) the goods otherwise satisfy the applicable requirements of subdivisions (r), (s) and (t) where no change in tariff classification is required, and the goods satisfy all other requirements of this note; or\r\r(iii) they are goods produced entirely in the territory of Canada, Mexico and/or the United States exclusively from originating materials; or\r\r(iv) they are produced entirely in the territory of Canada, Mexico and/or the United States but one or more of the nonoriginating materials falling under provisions for \""parts\"" and used in the production of such goods does not undergo a change in tariff classification because--\r\r(A) the goods were imported into the territory of Canada, Mexico and/or the United States in unassembled or disassembled form but were classified as assembled goods pursuant to general rule of interpretation 2(a), or\r\r(B) the tariff headings for such goods provide for and specifically describe both the goods themselves and their parts and is not further divided into subheadings, or the subheadings for such goods provide for and specifically describe both the goods themselves and their parts, \r \t\rprovided that such goods do not fall under chapters 61 through 63, inclusive, of the tariff schedule, and provided further that the regional value content of such goods, determined in accordance with subdivision (c) of this note, is not less than 60 percent where the transaction value method is used, or is not less than 50 percent where the net cost method is used, and such goods satisfy all other applicable provisions of this note.\r\r\tBased on the facts provided, the goods described above will qualify for NAFTA preferential treatment, because it will meet the requirements of HTSUS General Note 12(b)(ii)(A). The goods will therefore be entitled to a free rate of duty under the NAFTA upon compliance with all applicable laws regulations and agreements, including Regional Value Content requirements specified in General Note 12(t)/64.

Spraitzar,\rLaw Offices of George R. Tuttle, P.C.\rThree Embarcadero Center, Suite 1160\rSan Francisco, California 94111\r\rRE:\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Classification of men’ s board shorts\r\r\rDear Mr. Spraitzar:\r\rThis is in reply to your letter, dated July 11, 2006, in which you requested on behalf of your client, Fox Racing USA, Inc. of Morgan Hill, California, a binding tariff classification determination under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) of certain men’s board shorts, identified as “Bankvaults Board Short,” Product Id #41013.  A sample of the subject merchandise was forwarded along with this request for our review.\r\rWe received your faxed supplemental submission on October 10, 2006 in which you requested publication of this determination for public comment in the Customs Bulletin since you believe this matter has significant impact upon members of the trade.  However, we are declining your request because it is our view that the classification of this type of merchandise has been addressed by Court of International Trade in the decision of Hampco Apparel, Inc. v. United States, 12 CIT 92 (1988) and several CBP rulings (e.g., HQ 966600, dated November 6, 2003 and HQ 955009, dated November 29, 1993). \r\rFACTS:\r\rThe submitted men’s sample, which is sized 38-inches in the waist, is identified as the “Bankvaults Board Shorts” and is constructed of woven 100 percent polyester fabric.  It features a front zipper closure with a textile four-grommet lace-up tie cord and a zippered rear pocket with three grommets for drainage.  The waist of the short is not elasticized and does not have a drawstring threaded through it.  There is no internal support liner.  The short is used when a person is engaged in surfing, other boarding activities, and similar beach activities.\r\rIn your submission, you state that the polyester microfiber fabric does not retain water and is capable of drying quickly after being wet.  You discussed the subject garment’s care label which indicates that no ironing is required, which you assert is a care feature that is consistent with swimwear merchandise.  You also indicated that the subject garment does not need an inner mesh liner since its longer leg and closer-fitting features prevent exposure while swimming and provides appropriate crotch support.\r\rYou indicate that the merchandise will be sold with a “wax comb” accessory for use in roughing up the wax surface of the surfboard to provide greater <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> traction in the zippered back pocket.  The zipper closure allows the wearer to keep small valuables in the pocket without loss or theft.  \r\rISSUE:\u000B\rWhether the submitted sample is properly classified as men’s swimwear of heading 6211, HTSUS, or men’s shorts of heading 6203, HTSUS? \r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\u000B\rMerchandise is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  When goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1 and if the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes do not require otherwise, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 may be applied. \r\r\tAdditionally, the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) are the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS.  See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rIn Hampco Apparel, Inc. v. United States, 12 CIT 92 (1988), the Court of International Trade stated that three factors must be present if a garment is to be considered swimwear for tariff purposes:\r\t\r(1) the garment has an elasticized waistband through which    a drawstring is threaded,\r(2) the garment has an inner lining of lightweight material,   namely nylon tricot, and\r(3) the garment is designed and constructed for swimming.\r\rThe court also considered whether a garment is designed, manufactured, marketed and intended to be used as swimwear.  It is noted that although the Hampco decision involved classification of swimwear under the Tariff Schedules of the United States, it is relevant to decisions under the HTSUSA as the tariff language at issue is the same and the current tariff does not offer any new or different guidance regarding the distinction between swimwear and shorts.  See HQ 966600, dated November 6, 2003; see also Intercontinental Marble Corp. v. United States, 381 F.3d 1169, 1173, citing to H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 100–576, at 549-50 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N 1547, 1582-83.\r\rIn the informed compliance publication, \""Apparel Terminology under the HTSUS,\"" dated July 2006, CBP defines swimwear as:\r\rSwimwear (6112, 6211) - is a term referring to garments designed for swimming.  \tIncluded in this term are swim trunks, which usually have an elasticized waist with a drawstring threaded through it, and a full lightweight support liner.  Garments that cannot be identified specifically as swim trunks will be considered shorts.  Multiple-use \""sports\"" or \""athletic\"" shorts that bear a close resemblance to swim trunks and are designed for running, team sports etc. are not considered swimwear. \r\r\t\t\t*  \t\t* \t\t * \t\t * \u000BSee U.S. Customs and Border Protection, What Every Member of the Trade Community Should Know About: Apparel Terminology Under the HTSUS. Revised July 2006 (available at www.cbp.gov).\r\rFurthermore, in circumstances such as these, where the identity of a garment is ambiguous for classification purposes, reference to The Guidelines for the Reporting of Imported Products in Various Textile and Apparel Categories, CIE 13/88, (“Guidelines”) is appropriate.  The Guidelines were developed and revised in accordance with the HTSUSA to ensure uniformity, to facilitate statistical classification, and to assist in the determination of the appropriate textile categories established for the administration of the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles. \r\rThe Guidelines state:\r\rGarments commercially known as jogging or athletic shorts are normally loose fitting short pants usually extending from the waist to the upper thigh and usually have an elastic waistband.  They may resemble swim trunks for men, boys, or male infants, which are not included in this category. \r\rSwim trunks will usually have an elasticized waist with a drawstring and a full lightweight support liner.  Garments which cannot be recognized as swim trunks will be considered shorts. \r\rCBP has been consistent in ruling that even in those instances where the first two factors enumerated by the court in Hampco are present, the third factor (the garment is designed and constructed for swimming) must still be present.  Where the third factor is lacking, the article will be considered shorts (See HQ 086436, dated May 3, 1990; HQ 086979, dated May 15, 1990; HQ  087476, dated Sep-tember 7, 1990; HQ 950207, dated December 3, 1991 and HQ 950652, dated February 12, 1992).  As such, CBP’s analysis is in fact a two part test that is, (a) an examination of the physical attributes of the garment (three Hampco features); and (b) where ALL three features are not present, we then look to the design, manufacture, marketing or advertising, intended use of the garment and principal use of the garment for guidance.  \r\rHowever, in this case, the subject garment does not meet the Hampco criteria since it does not have an inner lining of lightweight material nor a fully elasticized waistband through which a drawstring is threaded.  Moreover, it is unclear that the subject garment is principally for swimming since it appears to be a multi-use garment.  As previously noted, CBP recognizes that if garments cannot be recognized as swim trunks, they will be considered shorts.” See Apparel Terminology ICP (July 2006). \r\rIn light of the foregoing, we will look to the garment’s design, manufacture, and marketing for guidance about its principal use.  First, you state that the subject garment is marketed and commonly sold at stores that specialize in outdoor sports, such as surfing stores, etc., and at certain stores in the section where swimwear is offered for sale.  In your submission, you provided a CD–ROM that depicts the instant garment being worn during surfing and fishing activities.  We cross-referenced the Internet and located various websites, which show a similar Fox Racing board short and other similar designed “Hawaiian-style” surfboard shorts that also feature the longer leg cut designs.  These garments are marketed and displayed for use in such activities as motor sports\u0002, surfing, kayaking, volleyball, beach lounging and swimming.  Furthermore, it is noted that although board shorts were historically designed as swimwear, they may be “worn as sportswear or even casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> by men, women and children.”  See “Board Shorts” by Eddie Tobey at www.ezinearticles.com.  However, based on review of your client’s product and other similar board shorts styles, these are multipurpose garments designed for use in water sports, for use as casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> on the beach, to beyond the beach for activities such as hiking and skateboarding. \r\rNotwithstanding the subject garment’s features and your assertion that it is marketed and sold for swimming, this does not prove its principal use for swimming.  Rather, it is clear that the merchandise is a multipurpose garment.  It is possible that these garments might be worn for swimming, but CBP believes such a use would be a fugitive one and would not be the use for which the garment is primarily purchased or designed.  In regard to use, the Court in Hampco, at 96, stated:\r\u000BThe fact that a garment could have a fugitive use or uses does not take it out of the classification of its original and primary use.  The primary design, construction, and function of an article will be determinative of classification, whether or not there is an incidental or subordinate function.  Trans\u001EAtlantic Co. v. United States, 67 Cust. Ct. 296, 299, C.D. 4288 (1971), aff'd, 60 CCPA 100, C.A.D. 1088, 471 F.2d 1397 (1973). \r\rThe court's remarks regarding swimwear susceptible to fugitive uses may also be said of sports shorts designed primarily for uses other than swimming, but which could be used for swimming.  The fact that the shorts may be used for other incidental purposes including swimming, does not change their character as shorts. Such a use would be a fugitive use.  \r\rBased on the aforementioned, the subject board shorts are not swimwear of heading 6211, but are classifiable in heading 6203, HTSUSA, as shorts.  For other cases which classified similar board shorts, see New York Ruling Letters (NY) J87126, dated August 20, 2003 and NY F80514, dated December 27, 1999; Headquarters Ruling Letters (HQ) 951639, dated July 31, 1992, HQ 955009, dated November 29, 1993, and HQ 966600, dated November 6, 2003.\r\rHOLDING:\r\rBy application of GRI 1, the Bankvaults Board Shorts, identified as style #41013, are classifiable in heading 6203, HTSUS.  They are provided for in subheading 6203.43.4030, HTSUSA, which provides for “Men’s or boys’…trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches and shorts (other than swimwear):  Trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches and shorts: Of synthetic fibers:  Other:  Other:  Other: Other, Shorts:  Men’s.”  The column one, general rate of duty is 27.9 percent ad valorem.  The applicable textile category designation is 647.  \r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.  The text of the most recent HTSUSA and the accompanying duty rates are provided on the world wide web at www.usitc.gov.  \r\rWith the exception of certain products of China, quota/visa requirements are no longer applicable for merchandise which is the product of World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries.  The textile category number above applies to merchandise produced in non-WTO member-countries.  Quota and visa requirements are the result of international agreements that are subject to frequent renegotiations and changes.

The doll stands three feet\rhigh.  Her feet are flat, thus, enabling the doll to stand on her\rown.  Barbie's torso, legs and feet will be injection molded of\rABS plastic.  Her head and arms will be roto-cast in plastisol,\rand she will have rooted hair made of kanekelon.\r\r     Barbie will be imported fully dressed in a three-piece\rcostume with ballerina slippers.  The outfit may be transformed\rinto three dress-up costumes (princess, ballerina and beach fun).\rThe princess skirt is made of pink nylon tulle with polyester\rglitter and silver metallic thread.  The ballerina tutu is made\rof pink nylon tulle with polyester glitter and silver metallic\rthread with the slippers being constructed of pink nylon knit\rinterlock with a pink satin finished ribbon.  The swim suit is\rmade of pink poly cotton lycra with sequins.  Each outfit is\rcapable of being worn by a child aged 3-7.  The intent of these\rspecially designed clothes is for a child to pretend she is\rBarbie and/or to draw the child into Barbie's fantasy world of\rfashion and glamour.     \r\r     In addition, the following accessories will be included with\rBarbie: a necklace for the doll which transforms into a small\rtiara for the little girl, a pair of snap-on earrings, nail\rpolish and lip gloss for the doll and/or child to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.         \r     \""My Size Barbie\"" will be imported packaged in a closed\rcardboard box ready for retail sale.  The contents of the box\rwill be: a three <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> high Barbie doll dressed in a three piece\rcostume, a pair of earrings, a necklace, nail polish and lip\rgloss.\r     \r     Barbie is designed for the amusement of children and is a\rrepresentation of a human being.  She meets the definition of a\rdoll.  Classification is based upon the General Rules of Inter-\rpretation.  Specifically GRI 3(b) states \""goods made up of\rdifferent components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale,\rwhich cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be\rclassified as if they consisted of the material or component\rwhich gives them their essential character\"".  In the case of \""My\rSize Barbie\"" the Barbie doll imparts the essential character of\rthe set.     \r\r     Additionally, you indicate in your letter that Barbie's head\rand arms will be manufactured in China and her legs and torso\rwill be from Mexico.  The tiara and earrings will be dual sourced\rin China and Mexico.  The cosmetics will be manufactured in the\rUnited States and exported to Mexico for repackaging with\r\""Barbie\"".   \r\r     The Generalized System of Preferences allows eligible\rarticles which are the growth, product or manufacture of a\rdesignated beneficiary developing country (BDC) which are\rimported directly into the customs territory of the U.S. from the\rBDC to receive duty-free treatment if the sum of (1) the cost or\rvalue of materials produced in the BDC, plus (2) the direct costs\rof the processing operation in the BDC, is equivalent to at least\r35% of the appraised value of the article at the time of entry. \rSee 19 U.S.C. 2463(b).\r\r     Effective August 20, 1990, in section 226 of the Customs and\rTrade Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-382), an amendment was issued\rto the GSP statute requiring an article to be a \""product of\"" a\rGSP country for it to receive duty-free treatment.  This\rrequirement means that to receive duty-free treatment, an article\reither must be made entirely of materials originating in the\rbeneficiary country or, if made of materials from a non-\rbeneficiary country, those materials must be substantially\rtransformed in the beneficiary country into a new or different\rarticle of commerce.\r\r\r     In T.D. 91-7, Customs held that as a general rule, a\rcollection classifiable in one subheading pursuant to the GRI's\rwill receive GSP treatment only if all of the items or components\rin the collection are considered \""products of\"" the beneficiary\rcountry.  Additionally, in cases where the entire imported set is\rnot the \""product of\"" a BDC, as required by the GSP statute,\rneither the set nor any part thereof would be entitled to duty-\rfree treatment under this program.   \r\r     Mexico is a designated BDC as listed in General Note\r3(c)(ii)(A), Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\rAnnotated (HTSUSA) and the classification for dolls is a GSP\religible provision.  Therefore, \""My Size Barbie\"" will be entitled\rto duty-free treatment if the entire set is considered to be a\r\""product of\"" Mexico and the 35% value-content requirement is met.\r\r     As previously stated, Barbie's head and arms are made in\rChina (a none BDC) and her legs and torso are made in Mexico. \rThe assembly operation performed in Mexico may consititute a\rsubstantial transformation.  However, Barbie's necklace and\rearrings will be dual sourced from China and Mexico.  Further,\rthe cosmetics are U.S. sourced.  Therefore, the set is not a\r\""Product of\"" Mexico. \r     \r     The applicable subheading for the \""My Size Barbie\"" will be\r9502.10.8000, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\r(HTS), which provides for dolls representing only human beings:\rwhether or not dressed: other: other: other.  The duty rate will\rbe 12 percent ad valorem.\r       \r     HTSUS subheading 9801.00.10 provides for the duty-free entry\rof products of the U.S. that are returned after having been\rexported, without having been advanced in value or improved in\rcondition by any process of manufacture or other means while\rabroad, provided there has been compliance with the documentary\rrequirements of section 10.1, Customs Regulations (19 CFR10.1).\r\r     On basis of the information provided, the cosmetics of U.S.\rorigin, will not be advanced in value or improved in condition as\ra result of the various packaging operations abroad, will be\religible for the duty exemption available under HTSUS subheading\r9801.00.10 when returned to the U.S., provided the documentary\rrequirements of 19 CFR 10.1 are satisfied.   \r\r     This ruling is being issued under the provisions of Section\r177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r     A copy of this ruling letter should be attached to the\rentry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported. \rIf the documents have been filed without a copy, this ruling\rshould be brought to the attention of the Customs officer\rhandling the transaction.\r\r\r                                 Sincerely,\r\r                                   \r  \r                                 Jean F.

"{""text"":""NY K81287\r\rNovember 21, 2003\rCLA-2-64:RR:NC:247: K81287\r\rCATEGORY:  Classification\r\rTARIFF NO.:\t6404.19.35\r\rMr. Roger Crain\rCustoms Science Services, Inc.\r11901 Reynolds Avenue\rPotomac, MD 20854-1106\r\rRE:\tThe tariff classification of reversible footwear\r\rDear Mr. Crain:\r\r\tIn your letter dated November 19, 2003, you requested a tariff classification ruling on behalf of S. Goldberg.  The sample the Turnz 180 (Style No. EVL0345AGN) is a thong sandal with an outer sole of rubber or plastics.  You indicate that the “Y” shaped upper is reversible.  You state that there is a small plastic pivot at the top of the toe thong.  If the hook & loop straps securing the two arms of the “Y” are loosened, the upper can be turned 180 degrees through the plastic pivot and re-fastened.  In this way, the material that was against the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> is now on the external surface of the upper.  The material of one upper surface is plastic and the material of the other is textile.  You further state that when the shoes are exported to the United States the plastic side will be on the outside and the textile side on the inside.  You opine that in their condition as imported, the sandal will have uppers of plastic.\r\r\tYou opine further that you do not believe that General Rule of Interpretation 3 (c) applies in this case because the upper of the Turnz 180 is either plastic or textile but never both.  In your opinion, the only way GRI 3(c) would apply is if the external surface of the upper were exactly 50 percent of one material and 50 percent of another.\r\r\tHQ 958745 dated March 5, 1996 involved a similar situation and provides guidance for reversible items.  In that case the sample submitted was a reversible pullover garment. One side of the garment being woven cotton flannel material and the other side of knit cotton material.  The subject ruling explains:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI’s). GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes. Merchandise that cannot be classified in accordance with GRI 1 is to be classified in accordance with subsequent GRI's taken in order.\r\rAs the subject garment is comprised of knit material and woven material, it is a composite good for tariff classification purposes. GRI 3 applies to goods that are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings. GRI 3(b) states, in pertinent part, the following:\u000B\rMixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable. \u000B\rCustoms must determine which component imparts the garment's essential character. In this instance, the garment is reversible and depending on the choice of the wearer either side is equally suitable for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>. Therefore, neither of the constituent materials impart the essential character of the garment. \u000BAs none of the constituent materials impart the essential character of the merchandise in question, Customs must look to GRI 3(c) for classification of the article.\r\rGRI 3(c) provides, in pertinent part:\u000B\u000BWhen goods cannot be classified by reference to Rule 3(a) or 3(b), they are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration in determining their classification. \r\u000BAt first glance, the headings that equally merit consideration are Heading 6110, HTSUSA, the provision for knit pullovers, Heading 6205, HTSUSA, the provision for men's or boys shirts, and Heading 6211, HTSUSA, the provision for other garments. The Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (EN), although not legally binding are the official interpretation of the tariff at the international level. The EN to Heading 6205, HTSUSA, states that shirts are garments designed to cover the upper part of the body, having long or short sleeves and a full or partial opening starting at the neckline. The subject garment is not classifiable under Heading 6205, HTSUSA, since it is not constructed as a shirt of this heading with a partial or full opening. Instead, the subject garment is a pullover.  Also considering the heavy weight of the garment it is not designed for use as a shirt. Therefore, the headings that remain under consideration are Headings 6110 and 6211, HTSUSA. As Heading 6211, HTSUSA, comes last in numerical order, the subject article is classifiable under that heading. \r\rLikewise, in this situation we have an item with essentially two uppers, one of plastic classifiable in heading 6402 and another of textile material classifiable in 6404, both headings merit equal consideration.  In this regard the footwear is considered a composite good with neither the plastic nor the textile upper providing the essential character.  GRI 3 (c) provides that when goods cannot be classified by reference to Rule 3(a) or 3(b), they are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration in determining their classification.  In this situation, heading 6404 appears last.\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u000B\tThe applicable subheading for footwear style Turnz 180 will be 6404.19.35, (HTS), which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber/plastics and uppers of textile material, other, other, footwear with open toes or open heel.  The general rate of duty will be 37.5 percent ad valorem.\r\rThe submitted sample is not marked with the country of origin.  Therefore, if imported as is, will not meet the country of origin marking requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1304.  Accordingly, the footwear would be considered not legally marked under the provisions of 19 C.F.R. 134.11 which states, \""every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit, in such manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the U.S. the English name of the country of origin of the article.\""\r\r \tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

(\""applicant\"") with respect to the above-referenced\rvessel repair entry.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The evidence of record indicates the following.  The SEA-LAND KODIAK (the \""vessel\""), a U.S.-flag vessel, arrived at the\rport of Tacoma, Washington on December 9, 1997.  The subject\rvessel repair entry was subsequently filed.  The vessel underwent\rcertain foreign shipyard work in Canada. \r\rISSUE:\r\r     Whether the subject items are dutiable pursuant to 19 U.S.C.\r1466(a).\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     19 U.S.C. 1466 provides for the payment of duty at a rate of\rfifty percent ad valorem on the cost of foreign repairs to\rvessels documented under the laws of the United States to engage\rin foreign or coastwise trade, or vessels intended to be employed\rin such trades.\r\r     You request our determinations with respect to the items\rdiscussed below.\r\r     Kawasaki invoice no. 3145033-5 and Victoria Shipyards\rinvoice no. 9733.  The applicant states, with respect to these\ritems: \""We also seek relief from duty for the [e]mergency work\rperformed pertaining to the Controllable Pitch Propeller casualty\rand final repairs completion.\""  In support of its claim, the\rapplicant has provided a sheet from the master's log book and a\rsheet from the deck log book.  The master's log for August 11,\r1997 reflects that the \""chief engineer notified [the] bridge of\rlow pressure to the CPP system.\""  Immediately afterwards, the\r\""main engine tripped due to low CPP pressure\"" and the \""vessel\r[was] drifting with no propulsion.\""  Subsequently on the same\rday, the \""CPP failed to respond in any mode\"" and \""checks and\rtests were carried out ... with negative results.\""  The sheet\rfrom the deck log book, which is undated, reflects the same\rsituation, in virtually the same language.  One of the documents\rsubmitted with the application, entitled \""Summary of Pertinent\rIssues,\"" states: \""The motor Vessel Sea-Land Kodiak lost the\rfunction of the controllable pitch propeller (CPP) on Monday\rAugust 11, 1997, while at sea 400 miles off the coast of\rVancouver Island, BC.

See\rDollar Steamship Lines, Inc. v. United States, 5 Cust. Ct. 28-29,\rC.D. 362 (1940).

The AMERICAN DYNASTY\r(\""vessel\"") is a U.S.-flag vessel owned and operated by the\rapplicant.  It has registry and fisheries endorsements.  Certain\rforeign shipyard work was performed on the vessel in the second\rhalf of 1993.  The vessel arrived at the port of Seattle,\rWashington on December 23, 1993.  A vessel repair entry was filed\ron December 30, 1993.\r\r     You ask for our determination with respect to the following\ritems:\r\rItem No.       Vendor                Description\r1 4-4.03       Asmar (Talcahuano)    Rudder\r1 10-10.01     \""                \""    Recording thickness of hull\r                                     indents\r2              Asmar (Punta Arenas)  Checking system\r3              \""                  \""  Rubber system\r6              \""                  \""  Sonar repairs\r8              \""                  \""  Sonar repairs\r9              Det Norske Veritas    Survey\r\r     In its application, the applicant states as follows:\r\r     \r\r                              - 2 -\r\r     The fishing vessel AMERICAN DYNASTY while operating in the  \r     South Pacific off the coast of Chile encountered extremely  \r     heavy weather which caused damage to the rudder and to the  \r     sonar of the vessel.\r\r     The damage was sufficient enough to cause the master of the\r     vessel to divert the vessel to Punta Arenas, Chile to  undergo\remergency repairs.  As noted in the copies of the      vessel log\rattached and the statement of the master the      vessel was\rconsidered to be in a dangerous situation and     further operation\rwould cause additional damage and possibly   the loss of the rudder\rleaving the vessel to the perils of     the sea.\r\r     The statement of the master dated March 1, 1994 reads as\rfollows, in pertinent part:\r\r     1. Date and time of incident: June 24, 1993 @ 2010...\r     ...\r     3. Size of seas: 10-15 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span>; Beaufort scale of 4\r     ...\r     5. What steps were taken after the incident and why?\r          We felt a strong vibration coming from the stern,      \rcouple with steering difficulties.  We...determined that the\r     problem was indeed the rudder and in need of immediate\r     inspection...\r          The actions were taken because they were absolutely\r     necessary.  As master of the vessel, I felt the crew would  be\rin danger had we not gone to the Punta Arenas shipyard      \rimmediately.\r     ...\r     8. Could we have proceeded to the U.S. for repairs from the\r     area of the incident safely?\r          Absolutely not.  I believe the most prudent decision   \rwas to proceed to Punta Arenas.  After we discovered that   the\rtemporary repair to be ineffective it was necessary for     us to\ruse the Talcuano drydock to have the rudder put back   in a safe\roperational condition.\r\r     Additional correspondence dated February 14, 1994 from the\rmaster states as follows:\r\r     Regarding:  Rudder Failure on 6/24/93\r\r     At approximately 2000 on June 24th 1993 the AMERICAN DYNASTY\r     experienced partial rudder failure due to external forces of\r     nature...\r\r     Regarding:  Shattering of Sonar Dome on 9/24/93\r\r     At approximately 2137 on September 24th 1993 the AMERICAN\r     DYNASTY experienced the loss of the sonar dome.  The bow    \r\r                              - 3 -\r\r     thruster room, which provides physical access to the sonar,\r     was taking on water.  It was necessary to use emergency     \rwater pumps to correct for flooding.  The vessel was   definitely\rin an emergency state.\r\r     The record includes certain sheets which appear to be parts\rof the vessel's log.  \r\r     The sheet for June 24, 1993 states in pertinent part as\rfollows:\r\r     2000 ... position: Lat: 53-47's, 74-19'w.

United  States, 5\rCust. Ct. 28-29, C.D. 362 (1940)).  In the absence     of such a\rcasualty event, we must consider the repair to    have been\rnecessitated by normal <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and tear (ruling      106159, September\r8, 1983).\r     \r     In Dollar Steamship Lines, the court stated in pertinent part:\r\r     We are of the opinion that a casualty similar to \""stress of\r     weather\"" should be of necessity a happening that comes with\r     the violence of the turbulent forces of nature.\r\r     Black's Law Dictionary (Fifth Edition, 1979) defines casualty\ras follows:\r\r     A serious or fatal accident.  A person or thing injured,    \rlost or destroyed.  A disastrous occurrence due to sudden,       \runexpected or unusual cause.  Accident; misfortune or  mishap; that\rwhich comes by chance or without design.  A  loss from such an\revent or cause; as by fire, shipwreck,  lightning, etc.\r\r     After a consideration of the record, we find that the\rapplicant has not presented good and sufficient evidence that the\rvessel was compelled by stress of weather or other casualty to make\rthe subject repairs in order to secure the safety and seaworthiness\rof the vessel to enable her to reach her port of destination. \rStated more succinctly, the applicant has not established that\rcasualties occurred.  We use the plural of the word \""casualty\""\rbecause the record indicates that the crew of the vessel became\raware of the problems with the rudder and the sonar dome at two\rdifferent times which were three months apart.  The record does not\rindicate how the damage which necessitated the repairs occurred. \rThe record does not include adequate documentation upon which we\rcan conclude that the repairs were necessitated by a casualty, as\rthat term is described and defined above.  The statements of the\rmaster and the excerpts \r\r                              - 5 -\r\rfrom the vessel's log are far from adequate to meet the good and\rsufficient evidence standard.  \r\r     We note additionally that it is not clear from the record that\ritems two and three of the three-part test stated above have been\rsatisfied by good and sufficient evidence.  In a case such as this,\rthe record will frequently include a report of the U.S. Coast\rGuard, a classification society, or a surveyor, indicating that the\rvessel was in an unsafe and unseaworthy condition and that rerpairs\rwere necessary before it could proceed.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The applicant has not presented good and sufficient evidence\rthat it is entitled to remission of duties pursuant to 19 U.S.C.\r1466(d)(1).

Waara, as an enrolled member of the Chippewa Tribe of Lake Superior, may import from Canada, free of duty, certain unworked rubies and sapphires that originate from the Peoples Republic of China.  You cited Article III of the Jay Treaty of 1794, between Great Britain and the United States which permitted Indians dwelling on either side of the boundary line of Canada and the United States to pass or repass with certain  exemption of duties for goods.  We responded with informational letters dated June 28 and August 1, 1995.  However, in your letters dated August 28, October 1, and December 1, 1995, you waived your request for a meeting to discuss the issue and asked that we issue you a formal ruling in this matter.  Our decision follows.\r\rFACTS:\r\r\tThe facts are contained in the above introductory paragraph.  \rISSUE:\r\r\tThe issue is whether Article III of the Jay Treaty of 1794, between Great Britain and the United States permits native Indians the privilege to enter merchandise from Canada free of duties.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tThe pertinent part of Article III of the Jay Treaty of 1794, \t-2-\r\rbetween Great Britain and the United States that is in issue is as follows:\r\r\tNo duty of entry shall ever be levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation into said territories respectively, nor shall the Indians passing of repassing with their own proper goods and effects of whatever nature, pay for the same any impost or duty whatever.  But goods in bales, or other large packages, unusual among Indians, shall not be considered as goods belonging bona fide to Indians.\r\r\tThe decisions of the U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (the predecessor of the U.S. Court of Appeals For The Federal Circuit), are dispositive for the issue presented here.\r\r\tUnited States v. Mrs. P.L. Garrow, 24 CCPA 410, C.A.D. (1937), concerned a member of the St. Regis Tribe who carried into the United States, 24 baskets made of black ash splints, and  dyed in colors. The Court noted \""that for some years the protestant, together with others of her tribe, have been manufacturing baskets such as those in question here, for sale...\"" and \""that the protestant was bringing the baskets across the line to dispose of them at the store...\"" which \""was in the business of purchasing such baskets from the Indians for resale.\""  The Court further noted \""that the protestant was not carrying these baskets as a part of her household effects but had manufactured the same, and was, importing them for sale.\""  The baskets were classified as baskets under paragraph 411 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, dutiable at 50 percent ad valorem.  The protestant claimed duty free status under the terms of the treaty.\r\r\tAndrew Akins v. United States, 64 CCPA 68 (1977), concerned a Penobscot Indian, who carried a pair of hiking boots into the United States which he had purchased in Canada that were classified as <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, in item 700.45, Tariff Schedules of the United States, dutiable at 10 percent ad valorem (for a total of $1.20).  The protestant also claimed duty free status under the terms of the treaty.\r\r\tThe Court traced the history of the treaty and the statutory tariff laws enacted by the Congress.  The Court noted that\rsubsequent to the Jay Treaty and prior to the War of 1812, a provision closely patterned after the duty exemption of Article III was included in the Tariff Act of 1799 and continued until its repeal in 1897.  The Court concluded that the War of 1812 abrogated this specific part of the treaty that was no longer in force and that the repeal of the statutory provision ended the exemption.  In both cases, the Court found for the government.\r\r\tYou have raised a constitutional issue as to whether the \r\r\t-3-\r\rCongress can abrogate a provision of a treaty.  There are situations in which subsequent statutory law may abrogate a treaty.  We need not discuss them.  As an administrative agency, we have no authority to declare an enactment of the Congress as unconstitutional.  The issue of whether the laws of Congress are constitutional is reserved for the courts and the Federal courts have ruled that the abrogation of the part of Article III of the Jay Treaty in question was in accordance with the Constitution.  In the absence of new statutory law, we are bound by the decision of the Federal courts.\r\r\tYou also cited a treaty known as the Treaty With The Wyandot, Etc., 1815, between the United States and several tribes, including the Chippewa as the basis for the duty exemption.  We need not consider whether the treaty is in full force and effect.  The document that you submitted does not contain an exemption from duties as in the Jay Treaty.  We conclude based on the document submitted that the treaty, if in full force and effect, does not provide for the duty exemption.  Further, if Article III of the Jay Treaty was included as a privledge in the Wyandot Treaty, commercial transactions were not covered by Article III.\r\r\tThe Jay Treaty exempted from duty \""their own proper goods and effects\"" but \""goods in bales, or other large packages, unusual among Indians, shall not be considered as goods belonging bond fide to Indians\"".  The treaty also listed one item that was considered as goods belonging to bona fide Indians as peltries, pelts or fur-bearing skins, an essential necessity of life for Indians at that point in time.  \""Goods in bales or large packages, unusual among Indians\"", that is to say, commercial goods, were excluded.  Based on the treaty, we conclude, that even if the treaty were still in force and effect, commercial transactions as contemplated here were excluded from the exemption. \r\r\t The Court in United States v. Garrow, supra, noted \""that the protestant was not carrying these baskets as a part of her household effects but had manufactured the same, and was, importing them for sale\"".  The importation concerned a commercial transaction and the Court stated the following at page 413:\r\t\r\tAssuming, for the sake of argument, that Article 3 was not abrogated but is still in force and effect, the importation is not within the purview of the language of said Article 3.\r\r\tThe Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, provided for certain exemptions from duties for the goods of residents and non residents and the provisions are now found in Chapter 98 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).  However, commercial transactions were always excluded.  The personal exemptions were not claimed as a basis for free entry in \t-4-\r\rthe court cases.  \r\r\tFinally, General Note 1, HTSUS, provides, in part, that \""all goods provided for in this schedule and imported into the customs territory of the United States from outside thereof...are subject to duty or exempt therefrom as prescribed in general notes 3 through 14, inclusive, and general note 16.\""  There is no exemption in the general notes that would provide an exemption from duty for goods imported by native Indians and/or members of the Chippewa of Lake Superior.  Since the contemplated importations are of a commercial nature, the provisions of Chapter 98 are also not applicable.  The HTSUS is statutory law enacted by the Congress and it is binding upon the Customs Service.  In such circumstances, we must conclude that there is no applicable exemption from duty.\r\t\rHOLDING:\r\r\tArticle III of the Jay Treaty which provided for exemption from duties on goods belonging to native Indians passing or repassing the borders of Canada and the United States was abrogated by the War of 1812.

The correct classification is\ras follows.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The merchandise at issue is a seven <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> artificial\rScandinavian fir Christmas tree, stock number 80701.  It is\ressentially composed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  The strip\rwhich is used to construct the tree, and is twisted around a\rwire, is comb-shaped and of extruded plastic, approximately 5 cm\rin width.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Whether the Christmas tree is classifiable in subheading\r9505.10.2500 as festive articles, articles for Christmas\rfestivities, Christmas ornaments, or in either subheading\r9505.10.4000 or 9505.10.5000 as festive articles, articles for\rChristmas festivities, other.\r\r\r\r\r\r                               -2-\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     The General Rules of Interpretation (GRI's) taken in their\rappropriate order provide a framework for classification of\rmerchandise under the HTSUSA.  Most imported goods are classified\rby application of GRI 1, that is, according to the terms of the\rheadings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or\rchapter notes.  The Explanatory Notes (EN's) to the Harmonized\rCommodity Description and Coding System, which represent the\rofficial interpretation of the tariff at the international level,\rfacilitate classification under the HTSUSA by offering guidance\rin understanding the scope of the headings and GRI's.\r     \r     Heading 9505 provides for, inter alia, festive, carnival and\rother entertainment articles.  The EN's to 9505 indicate that the\rheading covers:\r\r          (A) Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles,\r          which in view of their intended use are generally \r          made of non-durable material.  They include:\r\r               (1) Decorations such as festoons, garlands,       \r               Chinese lanterns, etc., as well as various        \r               decorative articles made of paper, metal foil,    \r               glass fibre, etc., for Christmas trees (e.g.,     \r               tinsel, stars, icicles), artificial snow, coloured\r               balls, bells, lanterns, etc.  Cake and other      \r               decorations (e.g., animals, flags) which          \r               are traditionally associated with a particular    \r               festival are also classified here.\r\r               (2) Articles traditionally used at Christmas\r               festivities, e.g., artificial Christmas trees     \r               (these are sometimes of the folding type),        \r               nativity scenes, Christmas crackers, Christmas    \r               stockings, imitation yule logs....\r\r                             *  *  *\r\r     In general, merchandise is classifiable in heading 9505,\rHTSUSA, as a festive article when the article, as a whole:\r\r     1.   is of non-durable material or, generally, is not\r          purchased because of its extreme worth, or intrinsic   \r          value (e.g., paper, cardboard, metal foil, glass fiber,\r          plastic, wood);\r\r     2.   functions primarily as a decoration (e.g., its primary\r          function is not utilitarian); and\r\r\r\r                               -3-\r\r     3.   is traditionally associated or used with a particular\r          festival (e.g., stockings and tree ornaments for       \r          Christmas, decorative eggs for Easter).\r\r     An article's satisfaction of these three criteria is\rindicative of classification as a festive article.  The motif of\ran article is not dispositive of its classification and,\rconsequently, does not transform an item into a festive article.\r     \r     First, the Christmas tree is made of non-durable material. \rCustoms will consider an article, such as the Christmas tree, to\rbe made of non-durable material since it is not designed for\rsustained <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and tear, nor is purchased because of its extreme\rworth or value (as would be the case with a decorative, yet\rcostly, piece of art or crystal).\r\r     Next, the article's primary function is decorative, as\ropposed to, utilitarian.  It is apparent, the Christmas tree\rserves no useful function besides its role as a decoration.\r\r     Finally, when examining the Christmas tree, as a whole, it\ris evident that it is traditionally associated or used with the\rparticular festival of Christmas.  Artificial Christmas trees are\rcited in the EN's to 9505, as exemplars of traditional, festive\rarticles.  \r     \r     Subheading 9505.10 includes articles for Christmas\rfestivities.  As for the proper classification of the Christmas\rtree at the eight digit subheading level, subheadings 9505.10.10,\r9505.10.15, and 9505.10.25 cover Christmas ornaments of glass,\rwood and other, respectively.  To qualify as a Christmas\rornament, Customs requires that the following three criteria be\rmet: \r\r          1.   the item is advertised and sold\r               as a Christmas tree ornament;\r\r          2.   there is some method, generally\r               a loop attached to the top, to hang\r               the item on a tree; and\r\r          3.   the item is not too big or too\r               heavy to be hung or attached to a \r               tree.\r\r     The artificial Christmas tree does not meet these criteria. \rThus, it is not classifiable as a Christmas ornament.\r\r\r\r  \r\r                               -4-\r\r     Subheading 9505.10.40 covers other Christmas articles of\rplastics, while 9505.10.50 covers other Christmas articles, other\r(than of plastics).  In this regard, we note that the Christmas\rtree contains plastic with a width of approximately 5 cm.  The\rEN's to 5404 and 5405, HTSUSA, providing for, inter alia, strip\rand the like of synthetic or artificial textile materials,\rindicate that:\r\r          [t]he strips of [these] heading[s] are flat, of a\r          width not exceeding 5 mm, either produced as such by\r          extrusion or cut from wider strips or from sheets.\r\rAs the Christmas tree is made of plastic strips that exceed 5mm,\ras opposed to textile strips, it is classifiable in 9505.10.40. \rSee Headquarters Ruling Letter 089335, issued June 24, 1991,\rwhere artificial Christmas trees were similarly classified.  \r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The artificial Christmas tree is classifiable in subheading\r9505.10.4000, HTSUSA, as \""Festive, carnival or other\rentertainment articles,...Articles for Christmas festivities and\rparts and accessories thereof: Other: Of Plastics.\""  The general\rcolumn one rate of duty is 8.4 percent ad valorem.

(Kern), requesting a country of origin ruling of retractor\r            springs for seat belts imported from Mexico.\r\r            FACTS:\r\r                 Your submission indicates that the merchandise at issue\r            consists of retractor springs for seat belts processed from\r            coils of rolled steel in Mexico.  Kern imports large coils of\r            rolled steel under bond from West Germany to its Mexican\r            affiliate.\r\r                 The coils of rolled steel undergo the following processing\r            in Mexico:\r\r                  (1) The coil is split into strips.\r\r                  (2) The strips are processed into springs by cutting\r                      them to length and coiling.\r\r                  (3) The spring coils are heated to 230 degrees\r                      centigrade for 30 minutes.\r\r                  (4) Each spring is then assembled into a plastic\r                      spring housing, connected to a spring cup and\r                      lubricated.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 2 -\r\r                 Kern's Mexican affiliate delivers the finished spring\r            assemblies to unrelated Mexican companies, who incorporate them\r            into a completed automotive seat belt retractor assembly and\r            then ships them to the U.S.\r\r                 Kern argues that the processing in Mexico substantially\r            transforms the steel coil into a new and different product for\r            tariff purposes, so that Mexico becomes the country of origin.\r\r            ISSUE:\r\r                 Whether the processing operations performed on the steel\r            coil in Mexico substantially transform it so that it becomes a\r            product of Mexico.\r\r            LAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r                 For tariff purposes, the courts have held that a\r            substantial transformation occurs if a new and different\r            article emerges having a distinctive name, character or use.\r            Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association v. The United States, 207\r            U.S. 556 (1908) and  Uniroyal Inc. v. United States, 542 F.\r            Supp. 1026 (1982).\r\r                  Anheuser-Busch involved an action for drawback on corks\r            imported from Spain into the United States.  The corks\r            underwent a cleansing and coating process in the U.S.  The\r            court held that this process did not substantially transform\r            the merchandise into a different article and noted that \""a cork\r            put through the claimant's process was still a cork.\""  The\r            court in Uniroyal also followed the rationale of the Anheuser-\r            Busch decision and looked to both the processing that the\r            article undergoes and the nature of the change in the article\r            after processing.  In that case which dealt with <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>\r            uppers, the attachment of an outer sole to the upper was held\r            not to substantially transform the upper since it was a minor\r            manufacturing or combining process which left the identity of\r            the upper intact.\r\r                 Applying the test set out in Anheuser-Busch and Uniroyal,\r            Customs has addressed the issue of substantial transformation\r            in cases involving steel coil.  In a ruling letter dated\r            November 21, 1985 (File # 553739 KP), Customs ruled that\r            processing operations performed on imported coils substantially\r            transformed the coil so that it became a product of Panama.\r            The processing conducted on the coil included: (1) uncoiling,\r            flattening, and slitting the strip; (2) forming the strip into\r            tubes; (3) welding the seams; and (4) cutting the tube to\r            specific lengths.  We ruled that this process resulted in a new\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 3 -\r\r            and different article.  The steel coils imported into Panama\r            were flat rolled steel materials that lacked the\r            characteristics of steel tubes.  Thus, the processing\r            operations resulted in a product which had lost the identifying\r            characteristics of the steel sheet in coil form.\r\r                 Based on the test outlined in Anheuser-Busch and in\r            Uniroyal, a substantial transformation occurs if two things\r            exist.  First, a new and different article emerges, and\r            second, the new article has a distinctive name, character and\r            use.  The processing in Mexico in this case substantially\r            transforms the steel coils into a new and different article,\r            having a distinctive name, character or use.  Kern imports\r            large coils of rolled steel into Mexico.  After it is imported,\r            the coil is slit into strips, the strips are processed into\r            springs and heated to 230 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes;\r            and each spring is assembled into a plastic spring housing,\r            connected to a spring cup and lubricated.  Spring assemblies\r            are the end result of this processing.  Clearly, a new and\r            different article emerges.  Contrary to both Anheuser-Busch and\r            Uniroyal, the identity of the imported article does not remain\r            intact.  The steel is no longer flat rolled steel material in\r            coils, but has been manufactured into springs, which are used\r            in automotive seat belt retractor assemblies.\r\r                 The new article also has a distinctive name, character\r            and use.  The article imported into Mexico comes in as steel\r            coil, but after the processing becomes spring assemblies.  The\r            processes performed on the steel coil at issue in this case\r            result in the merchandise having a new character.  The\r            merchandise comes into Mexico as a flat rolled steel material.\r            However, after the processing, it is changed from steel sheets\r            to springs.  The new article also has a distinctive use.\r            Springs are used specifically in automotive seat belt retractor\r            assemblies, a use for which the steel sheets in coil are unfit.\r\r                 The imported merchandise in this case is similar to the\r            merchandise in Customs' ruling of November 21, 1985, and\r            undergoes some of the same processing.  The coils are cut into\r            strip, cut to length and coiled.  As in that ruling, the steel\r            coils imported into Mexico in this case are also steel\r            materials that lack the characteristics of springs.  Thus, the\r            processing operations result in a new and distinct product\r            which has a new name, identifying characteristics and a\r            different use from that of the steel coils.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 4 -\r\r            HOLDING:\r\r                 The processing operations performed in Mexico\r            substantially transform the steel coil; thus Mexico is the\r            country of origin of the springs for tariff purposes.\r\r                 As requested, your samples are being returned.\r\r                                        Sincerely,\r\r\r\r\r                                        John Durant, Director\r                                        Commercial Rulings Division\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r            allums library\r            6cc:  Area Director, New York Seaport\r            VEAllums:jaj:4/11/89\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1989/083313.doc"",""id"":680,""rulingNumber"":""083313"",""subject"":""Substantial Transformation of coil rolled steel"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1989-04-13T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[]}"

The first form consists of finished carpet floor\r          mats, each of which consists of nylon pile carpet with the\r          auto maker's name or trade logo on the carpet surface and a\r          PVC or latex base.  The second form is die-cut carpet for\r          floor mats which consists of nylon pile carpet only, pre-cut\r          to the prescribed shape.  The third form is nylon pile carpet\r          for floor mats in rolls approximately 41 inches wide by 60\r          yards in length.  The component material of chief value for\r          this merchandise in all three forms is nylon.\r\r               The above-listed entry was liquidated under the provision\r          for other articles not specially provided for, not ornamented,\r          of man-made fibers, pile or tufted construction in item\r          389.50, Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS).\r\r               The protestant claims that the merchandise is properly\r          classifiable under the provision for floor coverings of pile\r          or tufted construction, in which the pile or tufts were\r          inserted or knotted into a pre-existing base, of textile\r          materials, other, other, of man-made fibers in item 360.83,\r          TSUS.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r\r          ISSUE:\r\r               Does the instant merchandise fall within the definition\r          of \""floor coverings\"" for tariff purposes?\r\r          LAW AND ANALYSIS\r\r               Schedule 3, Part 5, Subpart A, Headnote 2(a), TSUS,\r          provides that \""the term 'floor coverings' means carpeting,\r          carpets, rugs, matting, and mats, all the foregoing of any\r          size or shape, including squares or other segments designed to\r          be joined together, suitable for use as floor coverings in\r          homes, business establishments, institutions, vehicles, or\r          elsewhere\"".\r\r               The words \""suitable for use\"" as applied in Customs law\r          mean actually, practically and commercially fit for such use.\r          Such suitability does not require that the merchandise be\r          chiefly used for the stated purpose, but it does require more\r          than evidence of a casual, incidental, exceptional, or\r          possible use.

Specifically, that ruling\r          held that automobile mats made of cocoa fiber are classifiable\r          as floor coverings.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                        - 3 -\r\r\r               We do not agree that CIE 1393/66 abstracted as T.D. 66-\r          72(12) supports the protestant's claim.  In that ruling it was\r          determined that carpets cut to a specific size and shape for\r          automobiles are classifiable as floor coverings.  That\r          merchandise is distinguishable from the instant automobile\r          mats in that it appears the carpeting was used to actually\r          cover the floor of an automobile, rather than as a protective\r          mat to be placed upon the existing floor covering.\r\r               We do not agree that HRL 046980 dated September 7, 1976,\r          supports the protestant's claim.  In that ruling it was held\r          that coir door mats claimed to be used in vestibules, hall-\r          ways, automobiles, etc., are classifiable as floor coverings.\r          However, it should be noted that the ruling states that \""[t]he\r          mats are placed on the floor with a degree of permanency * * *\r          they will last, depending on quality, from one season to 4 to\r          5 seasons.  They are not kept in a closet and used only during\r          inclement weather.  The mats cover a distinct area of a\r          floor.\""\r\r               We do not agree that HRL 066849 dated December 1, 1980,\r          supports the protestant's claim.  In that ruling it was held\r          that a bath rug designed to withstand the normal <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and tear\r          of a floor covering as well as absorb water is classifiable as\r          a floor covering.  It is our view that this bath rug differs\r          from the floor mats in issue because it is placed directly on\r          the floor.\r\r               We do not agree that HRL 077914 dated May 6, 1986,\r          supports the protestant's claim.  In that ruling certain fire-\r          retardant carpets or hearth rugs used to protect floor\r          coverings or the floor adjacent to the hearth were classified\r          as floor coverings.  Again, those carpets may be distinguished\r          from the instant floor mats because they are used to protect\r          the floor when there is no floor covering near the hearth.\r\r               The protestant's claim that T.D. 56521(64) supports its\r          position with respect to the automobile mats in issue is not\r          well founded.  In that ruling certain rubber matting in rolls\r          which was determined to be suitable for use as floor cover-\r          ings, protective coverings and automobile mats was classified\r          as floor coverings.  It appears to us that the rubber matting\r          had multiple uses including use directly over a floor.\r\r               HRL 045409 dated September 3,1976, does not appear to\r          support the protestant's position in this matter.  In this\r          ruling it was held that carpet blanks 6 feet long and 3 feet\r          10 inches wide are classifiable as floor coverings.  Noting\r          that there is an overlay of plastic located where an\r          automobile operator's <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> would rest while working the gas\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                        - 4 -\r\r\r          pedal and the presence of a circular hole cut into the carpet\r          blank for the headlight dimmer switch, it appears that these\r          carpet blanks directly cover the floor of the automobile.\r\r               With the exception of the ruling set out in T.D.\r          56041(71), modified by T.D. 56153(24), all of the rulings\r          cited by the protestant covered mats, carpets and rugs which\r          were used directly on the floor.  Thus, there was no question\r          that they were \""suitable for use\"" as floor coverings within\r          the purview of Schedule 3, Part 5, Subpart A, Headnote 2(a),\r          TSUS.\r\r               In Bureau Letter (B/L) MFC 475.24-002460, dated\r          February 27, 1970, this office ruled that a vinyl carpet\r          runner is not classifiable as floor covering, because  it is a\r          protector for a floor covering and is not suitable for use as\r          a floor covering.\r\r               In B/L MCS 475.24 dated March 9, 1970, this office ruled\r          that a carpet protective plastic matting is classifiable as\r          flexible sheets of plastics and not as floor coverings.\r\r               In HRL 068846 dated November 2, 1981, this office ruled\r          that a rubber floor mat placed over a car's natural floor\r          covering is classifiable under item 774.55, TSUS, rather than\r          as floor coverings.\r\r               It is our opinion that the last three rulings control the\r          classification of the instant merchandise.  Certainly it is\r          the common understanding that car mats represented by the\r          sample are used to protect existing floor coverings from\r          wearing out.  They are not placed directly over the floor of\r          an automobile.  Also, there has been no evidence submitted\r          showing that the automobile mats are actually used to cover\r          the original floor of an automobile.\r\r               In view of the foregoing it is our position that the\r          finished floor mats for automobiles and the die-cut carpets\r          for floor mats are classifiable as liquidated under item\r          389.50, TSUS.  Assuming that the carpeting imported in rolls\r          is suitable for use as a floor covering and is not dedicated\r          solely for use in the manufacture of floor mats, it is\r          classifiable under the provision for floor coverings of pile\r          or tufted construction, in which the pile or tufts were\r          inserted or knotted into a pre-existing base, of textile\r          materials, other, other, of man-made fibers in item 360.83,\r          TSUS.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                        - 5 -\r\r\r          HOLDING\r\r               The protest is denied as to the claimed classification of\r          the finished floor mats and die-cut carpets for floor mats.\r          The protest should be allowed as to the carpeting imported in\r          rolls provided it is suitable for use as floor covering and is\r          not dedicated solely for use in the manufacture of floor mats.\r          T.D. 56041(71) as modified by T.D. 56153(24) is revoked.\r\r               A copy of this decision should be attached to the Form 19\r          Notice of Action to be sent to the protestant.\r\r                                        Sincerely,\r\r\r\r\r                                        John Durant\r                                        Acting Director\r                                        Commercial Rulings Division\r\r\r          6cc: AD NY Seaport\r          1cc: Commercial Compliance\r          2cc: Chief CIE Branch\r          1cc: John Durant\r          DFCahill:mm:3/1/88\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1988/079710.doc"",""id"":13,""rulingNumber"":""079710"",""subject"":""Decision an Application for Further Review of Protest               No. 2704-5-004924"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1988-04-21T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""046980"",""066849"",""077914"",""045459"",""045409"",""068846""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[]}"

Attached to your memorandum was a\rcopy of a report from the Office of Regulatory Audit.  We regret\rthe delay in responding.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     In response to a request for an audit by your office, the\rOffice of Regulatory Audit, San Juan, performed an examination of\rthe accounting and import records of Morabella Shoe Corporation\r(Morabella) located in Isabela, Puerto Rico.  Based on the\rfindings of the audit report, your office proceeded to appraise\rthe imported merchandise at the invoiced unit values, plus an\radditional $318,138, which the auditors had determined had been\romitted from the importer's declared value.  This resulted in the\rassessment of an additional $11,771.12 in duties and merchandise\rprocessing fees.  The importer responded by filing this protest. \r\r     The record indicates that on April 6, 1990, Morabella made a\rdisclosure and tendered duties in the amount of $147,918.70 for\rfailing to declare $3,989,470 in dutiable values for 1989 entries\rof shoe uppers.  These undeclared values included overpayments to\rsuppliers, invoice undervaluations, undeclared values and\rundeclared assists.  Duty payments were accepted and allocated to\rtheir related entries.  The audit was conducted to determine\rwhether Morabella's disclosure to Customs regarding consumption\rentries filed during the period from January 1, 1989, through\rDecember 31, 1989 was complete and accurate. \r\r\r\r     In researching Morabella Shoe Corporation, the auditors \rlearned that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morse Shoe, Inc.,\ra subsidiary of Moacq Holding Corporation.  Morabella is related\rto White Cap <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Wear</span>, Inc., Isabela Shoe Corporation, and\rLowell Shoe Inc., all of which are owned by Morse Shoe, Inc.\rMorabella is engaged in the importation, manufacture and sale of\rladies finished footwear produced with imported leather uppers\rfrom Brazil, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Haiti.  All\rfootwear production is sold to their related company Lowell Shoe,\rInc.\r\r     The auditors selected 77 importations in the disclosure for\rtheir initial review, and later extended the audit to cover all\rentries from Brazil for the calendar year of 1989.  Based on\rtheir audit, the auditors concluded that there was an additional\r$304,163 in dutiable value which was still undeclared.  This\rresulted in an additional liability due to Customs of $11,771.12\rin duties and merchandise processing fees.  The analysis of\rundeclared values was broken down into five basic points or\rfindings.  The first area of undeclared value was that an\ranalysis of the 1989 trial balances and purchase register\rdisclosed that the importer carried on its books purchases for\r1989 for $11,300,226 but declared only $11,192,592 to Customs. \rIn other words, the importer did not declare $107,634, which left\ra duty liability of $4,165.44.  \r\r     The auditor's second finding was that an account settlement\roverpayment made by a supplier to the importer in the amount of\r$29,356 was dutiable.  The auditor found that there was an\ragreement by which the supplier agreed to reduce the price of\rfuture shipments by 10%.  The duty and merchandise processing fee\rowed from this overpayment were calculated at $1,136.08. \r\r     Finding number three was that the auditors found that the\rcontract prices on various styles of uppers were higher than the \rprices shown on the invoices.  The auditors felt that the value\rshown on the invoices should be considered invoice\rundervaluations, and calculated the additional duty and\rmerchandising processing fee owed at $2,454.55.\r\r     The fourth finding was that the importer failed to declare\rvalue in the form of omitted quantities on two entries.  The\rundeclared value amount was $73,321 with additional duties owed\rto Customs at $2,837.52.\r\r     Finally, the fifth finding was that the importer failed to\rdeclare dutiable assist costs supplied to Brazilian manufacturers\rin the form of amortization, materials, tubes machine parts, \rleather test instruments, and other assists not disclosed in the \rtender or consumption entries.  The total of the undeclared\rassists amounted to $27,427 for a duty and MPF liability of \r$1,061.43.\r\r     After the protest arrived at Customs Headquarters, the\rauditors revised their findings and determined that there was not\rsufficient evidence to support three of the claims against the\rimporter for undervaluation.  The auditors were willing to accept\rthe importer's claim that the Atlantica Account Settlement did\rnot result in a reduction in the invoice value of the goods. \rThey also agreed that there was not enough evidence to establish\rthat there were invoice undervaluations and that there were no\rundeclared imported merchandise. \r\r     However, the auditors continue to stand by their position\rthat the importer had failed to declare the full value of all\rtheir purchases for 1989, which created a duty liability of\r$4,165.44 and also failed to declare assist costs which left a\rduty liability of $1061.43.  In a letter dated November 10, 1994,\rthe importer's attorney stated that it has decided not to dispute\rthese two claims.\r\rISSUE:\r \r     Under the circumstances presented, was the imported\rmerchandise appraised correctly? \r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     As you know, merchandise imported into the United States is\rappraised in accordance with section 402 of the Tariff Act of\r1930, as amended by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (TAA: 19\rU.S.C. \u0015 1401a).  The preferred method of appraisement is\rtransaction value, which is defined as the \""price actually paid\ror payable for merchandise when sold for exportation for the\rUnited States,\"" plus certain enumerated additions. \r\r     In this case, the Office of Regulatory Audit has reviewed\rtheir original findings regarding the entries in question and has\rnow concluded that three of their original claims should be\rabandoned because of insufficient evidence.  Regulatory Audit has\rconcluded, however, that there is sufficient evidence to support\rtwo of the claims that the importer improperly valued the\rimported merchandise.  These claims were that the importer failed\rto declared the value of all their purchases in 1989 and certain\rdutiable assists.  The importer has decided not to contest these\rtwo findings.\r\r     Consequently, we find that the three claims noted above\rshould be abandoned, that the appraised value was correctly\rdetermined for the entries in question based on the two findings\rof Regulatory Audit which the importer is not contesting.    \r\fHOLDING:\r\r     Consistent with the discussion above, you are directed to\rgrant the protest in part regarding the three of the Regulatory\rAudit's findings that they have withdrawn and deny the protest\rconcerning the two Regulatory Audit's findings that are\runcontested.\r\r     A copy of this decision with the Form 19 should be sent to\rthe protestant.  In accordance with Section 3A(11)(b) of Customs\rDirective 099 3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject: Revised\rProtest Directive, this decision should be mailed by your office\rto the protestant no later than 60 days from the date of this\rletter.

Waite, Esq.\rAlston & Bird, LLP\r601 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.\rNorth Building, 10th Floor\rWashington, D.C. 20004-2601\r\rRe: \tPetition by Domestic Interested Party; Outer Soles of Textile; Tariff Engineering; Not Fraud or Artifice.\r\rDear Mr. Waite:\r\t\r\tThis letter is in response to your Petition by Domestic Interested Party (Petition), dated February 15, 2002, filed pursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1516, on behalf of your client, Mars Footwear, Inc.  In accordance with Section 175.21(a), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 175.21(a)), Customs published a notice titled “Receipt of Domestic Interested Party Petition Concerning Tariff Classification of Textile Slippers” (Notice), in the Federal Register, issued May 23, 2002, 67 Fed. Reg. 36301.  \r\rFACTS:\r\rThe imported footwear is a slipper that has an upper of textile material and an outer sole composed of unit-molded rubber/plastics with nubs measuring ¼ inch in diameter evenly spaced across its surface, over which is adhered a thin layer of textile fabric.  In New York Ruling Letter (NY) G89205 and NY G89960, both dated April 19, 2001, Customs classified this footwear under subheading 6405.20.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA), which provides for “Other footwear: With uppers of textile materials: Other,” which has a general column one rate of duty of 12.5 percent ad valorem. \r\rYou argue that the textile material adhered to the rubber/plastic is not plausible soling material, does not come into contact with the ground over the life span of the slipper and constitutes a disguise or artifice.  Accordingly, you contend that the footwear should be classified in subheading 6404.19.35, HTSUSA, as “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: Other: Footwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except footwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper: Other,” which has a general column one rate of duty of 37.5 percent ad valorem.\r\rSUMMARY OF COMMENTS:\r\rIn the Notice, Customs informed the public of the filing of your Petition and invited interested parties to submit comments on or before July 22, 2002.  A total of 32 comments were received in response to the Notice.  Twenty-seven of the commenters support your position and five of the commenters are opposed to your position.  Comments were received from footwear manufacturers and suppliers related to the domestic footwear industry, law firms, members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, domestic trade associations and foreign trade associations.  Many of the commenters raised economic or political issues.  These particular comments will be summarized.  However, because such comments involve issues that are outside Customs mandate, they will not be considered in this ruling letter.  Some comments were received outside the comment period and cannot be considered in Customs decision.  \r\rFifteen commenters argue that, because the textile material wears off after very limited use, the textile cannot be considered the material that comes into contact with the ground when the slipper is in use over the life-span of the slipper.  Accordingly, the textile cannot be considered the constituent material of the outer sole.\r\rTwenty-two commenters state that the thin layer of textile material is not a genuine or plausible soling material, because it serves no purpose and is not commercially recognized as textile soled slippers.  Many of these commenters attest that they are in the footwear business or are suppliers to footwear manufacturers and have first hand knowledge of the implausibility of the textile material as soling material. \r\rNineteen commenters argue that if Customs maintains its current position, U.S. industry as well as industries in Mexico and the Caribbean will be harmed.  They contend that the position is contrary to the intent of legislation and programs giving duty free preference to articles manufactured from U.S. components and assembled in Mexico or the Caribbean.\rSeventeen commenters argue that there has been a dramatic increase in imports of textile soled slippers from China, classified in subheading 6405.20.9015, HTSUSA.  These commenters cite to statistics from an U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) trade data report as support for their argument.  According to the trade report, there has been a 217% increase from 1996 to 2001 in the importation of textile soled house slippers.  Concurrently, the growth in imports of rubber soled slippers from China, classified in subheading 6404.19.3515, HTSUSA, for the same period was very small.  Most significantly, there was a 45% drop in rubber soled slippers, from 2000 to 2001, the time in which Customs issued its rulings on the subject slippers.  The commenters argue that the large tariff shift to textile soled slippers is evidence that the textile layer is artifice, and that it is an attempt by Asian manufacturers to compete with programs benefiting Mexico and Caribbean nations.  They further argue that U.S. trade laws are designed to encourage manufacturing in Mexico and the Caribbean, and thus, that Customs, when implementing the trade laws, must consider circumvention of the tariff by Asian producers.\r\rThree commenters argue that the U.S. footwear industry has adapted to foreign competition and is able to remain modestly competitive within certain limited markets.  They argue that Customs position on the instant footwear severely weakens the purpose of subheading 6404.19.3515, HTSUSA, and makes competing with foreign manufactures even more difficult.\r\rFour commenters argue that Note 4 (b) to Chapter 64 (stating that the constituent material of the outer sole shall be taken to be the material having the greatest surface area in contact with the ground, no account being taken of accessories or reinforcements. . . .) must be interpreted to include the basic minimum requirement that the material on the outer surface of the sole, must be legitimate soling material.  Moreover, the reference in the Note to excluding accessories and reinforcements is evidence that only genuine soling material is to be considered.  They contend that the thin textile layer is a reinforcement that is meant to be disregarded.  Finally, they argue in the alternative, that the textile cannot be reinforcement, because it serves no functional purpose. \r\rOne commenter quotes language in the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Act, which states that the “United States policy towards the region [Caribbean] should focus on expanding international trade with the Caribbean Basin region as an enduring solution for economic growth and recovery.”  The commenter argues that it was the intent of the U.S. Congress to promote trade with the Caribbean nations and Customs actions thwart the intent of Congress.\r\rTwo commenters argue that Customs interpretation of the HTSUSA in this case reduces government revenues for the sole benefit of a handful of overseas suppliers.\r\rFour commenters urge Customs to reasonably interpret the HTSUSA, and to not overlook the common and commercial meaning of “sole.”\r\rSix commenters argue that Customs position is damaging U.S. industry. \r\rOne commenter cites to Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 964978, dated April 18, 2002, HQ 965558, dated April 30, 2002, NY I82037 dated June 6, 2002, and NY I18211, dated June 6, 2002, as evidence that Customs has improperly applied the classification principle of the instant case to a women’s slip-on shoe, a girl’s textile upper boot, and to an athletic sneaker style shoe, all of which are intended for outdoor use.  In each of these cases, a thin layer of textile had been applied over the portion of the rubber/plastic outer sole otherwise in contact with the ground.  Customs is said to have failed to cite any commercial purpose connected to the manufacture or use of these shoes for the presence of the textile material.  The commenter uses these rulings as examples of how Customs position is being improperly applied to a broad range of footwear.  Except to the extent that issues addressed in this ruling are relevant therein, Customs will not address those rulings.\r\rOne commenter argues that Customs is overlooking the statement in U.S. v. Citroen, 223 U.S. 407 (1912), that “[t]his does not mean that a prescribed rate of duty can be escaped by resort to disguise or artifice.  When it is found that the article imported is in fact the article described in a particular paragraph of the tariff act, an effort to make it appear otherwise is simply a fraud on the revenue and cannot be permitted to succeed.”  The commenter then cites Heartland By-Products, Inc. v. United States, 264 F.3d 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2001), for the proposition that there must be a commercial purpose for the engineering of the product.\r\r\tOne commenter argues that the addition of the textile is a disguise or artifice, arguing that the textile material should not be allowed to disguise the commercial reality of the rubber/plastic outsole.  The commenter argues that there is a “commercially real caveat” to the proposition that goods are classified as imported, as stated in Citroen and Heartland.\r\rOne commenter argues that Customs position has the potential to completely disrupt the history and significance of the Census Bureau’s reporting of footwear imports into the U.S.  Approximately thirty-nine different subheadings under headings 6401, 6402 and 6404 could, by adding a textile covering to all or part of the outsole, be rendered classifiable under subheadings 6405.20.30, 6405.20.60 or 6405.20.90.\r\rOne commenter, citing many Customs rulings, argues that importers have a right to structure merchandise to obtain favorable tariff classifications. The commenter argues that Customs should not be in the business of having to determine whether there is a “commercial purpose” to every aspect of goods entered into the U.S.  Arguing that if Customs were required to make such determinations, Customs would have to reconsider and revoke many rulings.\r\rOne commenter argues that the Heartland decision does not diminish the importer’s right to engineer finished articles to obtain favorable tariff classifications.  This is because Heartland was decided on the issue of the definition of “foreign substances.”  The majority of the court specifically declined to address Customs argument that the actions by Heartland constituted disguise or artifice.\r\r\tThree commenters argue that the decision in Heartland upheld Customs determination that the actions of Heartland were disguise and artifice.\r \rThree commenters argue that the textile material is not an accessory or reinforcement pursuant to Note 4(b) because it is not ejusdem generis with the exemplars.  They cite several Customs rulings where Customs has ruled that similar attachments to the sole of a shoe are not accessories or reinforcements.\r\rFour commenters argue that where the external surface of the outer sole is made of two or more materials, the component material with the greatest surface area in contact with the ground will prevail.  The determination should not be based on which material is the best material for the outer sole.  They argue that to make such a determination would be impossible for Customs.\r\rFour commenters argue that the textile layer on the sole is not disguise or artifice but legitimate tariff engineering and there is no concealment as to the nature of the slippers.  They distinguish this case from HQ 955720, wherein Customs ruled that felt, which was easily removed, was disguise or artifice.  Another commenter notes other decisions by Customs wherein the manufacturer was allowed to engineer the footwear by adding weights, e.g.,  NY E81498, dated May 10, 1999.  They point out that all of the rulings cited by petitioner as prohibiting tariff engineering have one factor in common, i.e., the feature designed to qualify the imported article for a lower rate of duty or to permit admission did not, or was not likely to, reach the ultimate purchaser in the United States.  They contend that the subject situation is different because the textile material remains on the footwear until the time that it is purchased by the consumer and is subsequently worn off by actual use.\r\rOne commenter argues that retailers are finding footwear incorporating textile soles to be commercially viable and that if the Petition is approved, it is the U.S. consumer that will be harmed.\r\rFour commenters argue that classification should be based on the condition of the goods as imported and that consideration of subsequent deterioration and changes in the goods are irrelevant.\r\rOne commenter argues that results from the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> tests are not only irrelevant but unreliable because there were no control samples and because sufficient information detailing the parameters of the tests or how they were conducted were not provided.\r\rThree commenters argue that not only is the textile a legitimate soling material but that the Petition does not demonstrate that textile materials are inappropriate materials for the sole.\r\rTwo commenters point out that Customs has classified footwear with the opposite construction, i.e., a heavy textile sole with a thin layer of plastic, as having an outer sole of plastic.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhether slippers that have a thin layer of textile material applied to their rubber bottom in order to received a favorable duty rate are properly classified as footwear with outer soles of textile?\r \rLAW AND ANALYSIS: \r\rClassification under the HTSUSA is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI’s).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI may then be applied.  \r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN’s) represent the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level (for the 4 digit headings and the 6 digit subheadings) and facilitate classification under the HTSUSA by offering guidance in understanding the scope of the headings and GRI.  The EN’s, although not dispositive or legally binding, provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUSA, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.\r\rClassification of footwear is essentially based upon the composition of the outer soles and uppers. In pertinent part, General EN (C) to Chapter 64 defines outer sole as follows:  “The term \""outer sole\"" as used in headings 64.01 to 64.05 means that part of the footwear (other than an attached heel) which, when in use, is in contact with the ground.”  At the time of importation, it is the textile material of the instant slipper that is in contact with the ground when the slipper is being worn and used.\r \rThe Complete Footwear Dictionary, Rossi (2nd Ed. 2000), defines outer sole as follows:\r\rOutsole (or outersole).  The outermost sole of the shoe which is directly exposed to abrasion and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  It can consist of any of a variety of materials: leather, rubber, plastic, cork, rope, crepe, wood, etc., plus differences in thickness or degrees of flexibility, and an infinite variety of surface designs.\r\rPursuant to this definition, the sole of the instant slipper is the textile material, because it is the material that is directly exposed to abrasion and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  \r\rThe only limitation provided for in the EN is that an attached heel is not considered part of the outer sole.  This recognizes that certain components of a shoe should be excluded from consideration.  The fact that the heel is the only exclusion shows intent to define outer soles broadly.  Moreover, neither definition limits the type of material which may comprise the outer sole.  The definitions also do not describe the outer sole according to its durability. \r\rIn the case where a shoe has more than one material that is in contact with the ground, determinations regarding the constituent material of the outer sole are governed by Note 4(b), Chapter 64, HTSUS, which states that:\r\rThe constituent material of the outer sole shall be taken to be the material having the greatest surface area in contact with the ground, no account being taken of accessories or reinforcements such as spikes, bars, nails, protectors or similar attachments.\r\rSee also the EN to Chapter 64.\u0002  Again, there is no limitation on the type of material, the thickness, or the overall quality of the material that comprises the outer sole.  Moreover, the EN to heading 6405, HTSUSA, states, in pertinent part, that the heading includes footwear with outer soles of textile fabric. Accordingly, because it is the textile material that is in contact with the ground when the slipper is worn, the constituent material of the outer sole is the textile material and not the underlying rubber/plastic. \r\r\tYou maintain that the thin layer of textile material overlying the “rubber soles” of the slippers is akin to an accessory or reinforcement and, therefore, cannot be considered as the constituent material of the outer sole.  However, Customs rulings have consistently interpreted the terms accessories and reinforcements narrowly.  In HQ 958550, dated March 6, 1996, Customs, in considering the classification of an espadrille with a jute midsole, found that the rubber bottom covering the midsole was not an accessory or reinforcement.  Customs stated that:\r\rAlthough Note 4(b) does provide as an exception to the outer sole having the greatest contact with the ground, any \""accessories or attachments\"", it similarly defines those terms.  The words \""accessories\"" and \""reinforcements\"" are followed by a limited number of defining exemplars such as spikes, bars, nails, protectors or similar attachments.  To conclude that by similitude an entire external surface layer of rubber soling is included within the meaning of \""similar attachments\"" is not only unfounded but clearly contradicts the intended meaning of Note 4(b).\r\rHaving disposed of the argument that the rubber covering was an accessory or reinforcement, Customs concluded that the espadrille had an outer sole of rubber.  \r\rIn HQ 089250, dated December 27, 1991, Customs found that rubber traction lines, less than 1mm in thickness, were not accessories or reinforcements, and were to be included in the determination of the constituent material of the outer sole.  Similarly, “Customs does not consider plastic traction dots to be accessories or reinforcements.”  See HQ 088533, dated March 25, 1991.  See also HQ 085182, dated October 23, 1989 (finding that leather stitched over a textile outer sole is not an accessory or reinforcement under Note 4(b) but is the material of the sole in contact with the ground (modified on other grounds)).  \r\rLike the soling material in the rulings discussed above, the textile covering on the instant slippers is not similar to the exemplars listed in Note 4(b) to Chapter 64.  These rulings also demonstrate that Customs consistently looks to the material that is in contact with the ground when determining the constituent material of the outer sole. \r\rYou conducted a “<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> test” and an “abrasion test” to determine the durability of the textile material that comes into contact with the ground.  The results of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> test revealed that the textile material frayed and wore off of the nubs located at the ball and heel of the slipper after 30 days of normal use.  The abrasion test revealed that the textile material first began to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> off after 10 cycles.  After 100 cycles, approximately 60% of the textile material was worn off.  After 200 cycles, approximately 90% of the textile material was worn off.  In contrast, the rubber/plastic, that at the time of importation is covered by the textile material, showed minimal <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> when subjected to 200 cycles.\r\rYou rely upon the EN to Chapter 64 which state that the outer sole “means that part of the footwear . . . which, when in use, is in contact with the ground.”  You assert that because the textile material wears off in a relatively short period of time, the constituent material that is in contact with the ground over the life of the slippers is the rubber/plastic, not the textile material.  In other words, you are asking Customs to classify the slippers according to how they <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> over time.  \r\rIn U.S. v. Citroen, 223 U.S. 407 (1912), the Court clearly stated that when classifying goods, “the inquiry must be – Does the article, as imported, fall within the description sought to be applied?”  Id. at 415.  When classifying footwear, Customs cannot base its decision on the durability of the materials of the shoes.  As imported, the textile material covering the outer soles of the instant slippers, is the material that is in contact with the ground when in use.  For classification purposes, it is not relevant whether or not the textile material will continue to be in contact with the ground thirty or forty or sixty days after importation. \r\rYou, and a large number of the commenters, advance the argument that the textile material is not plausible soling material and is not a commercial reality.  Accordingly, you argue that Customs should find that the application of the textile material is a fraud or artifice. You cite HQ 952935, dated January 6, 1993, as support for this argument.  In HQ 952935, Customs found that it was fraud or artifice to classify footwear with rubber soles covered with removable felt as footwear with textile soles.  You quote the Customs statement that “[i]n its condition as imported we do not believe the shoe is a commercial reality . . . the felt layer is fugitive.”  Customs then listed many factors as to why the material was unsuitable as soling material.  Customs emphasized that, regarding “commercial reality,” there was a catalog showing that similar, if not identical, footwear was advertised and sold as wool clogs with rubber soles.  There was no felt covering the outer soles of the advertised footwear.  Thus, Customs found that the clogs were not sold in the condition as imported.\u0002  \r\rThis case exemplifies the distinction between when manipulation of an article in order to receive a lower tariff is considered acceptable tariff engineering and when manipulation constitutes a fraud or an artifice.  The concept of tariff engineering is based on the long-standing principles that merchandise is classifiable in its condition as imported and that an importer has the right to fashion merchandise to obtain the lowest rate of duty and the most favorable treatment. In Citroen, the Court stated that “although dutiable classification of articles imported must be ascertained by an examination of the imported article itself, in the condition in which it is imported [,] this, of course does not mean that a prescribed rate of duty can be escaped by resort to disguise or artifice.”  \r\rIn Merritt v. Welsh, 104 U.S. 694 (1881), the Court concluded that its task was to interpret the tariff as drafted by Congress.  If standards that were written into the tariff were no longer satisfactory, then it was up to the legislature to remedy the situation.  In Merritt the Court considered, hypothetically, the situation in which a sugar manufacturer would alter the color of the sugar in order to obtain a lower duty.  The Court stated:\r\rGreat stress is laid on the charge that sugars are manufactured in dark colors on purpose to evade our duties.  Suppose this is true; has not a manufacturer a right to make his goods as he pleases?  If they are less marketable, it is his loss; if they are not less marketable, who has a right to complain?  If the duties are affected, there is a plain remedy.  Congress can always adopt such laws and regulations as it may deem expedient for protecting the interests of the government.  \r\rId. at 701. \r\rIn Heartland By-Products, Inc. v. United States, 264 F.3d 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the court declined to resolve Customs claim that Heartland’s manipulation of its sugar imports were a fraud or artifice.  The court found in favor of Customs on other grounds.  However, in a concurring opinion, the honorable Judge Friedman, Senior Circuit Judge, agreed with Customs that Heartland’s actions were not legitimate tariff engineering.  In that case, Heartland added molasses to its already refined sugar, imported the sugar and, after importation, removed the molasses.  The sugar as imported was never entered into the stream of commerce.  Instead it was processed to return it to the state that it was in prior to importation.  Customs contended that the imported sugar was not a commercial reality and was fraud or artifice.   \r\rWhile there is little case law concerning finding tariff engineering to be a fraud or artifice, there are many Customs rulings on this issue.  The general position taken by Customs in these rulings is that if Customs finds the article, at the time of importation, is a commercial reality, then the tariff engineering will not be considered a fraud or artifice.  In the cases in which Customs has found that the tariff engineering was a fraud or artifice, Customs concluded that the article was not a commercial reality, in large part, because the article was not sold or otherwise entered into the stream of commerce in the condition as imported.  \r\rIn HQ 653704, dated March 8, 1985, involving a petition for relief from penalties, Customs found that the petitioner had deliberately attempted to avoid quota/visa restrictions.  In that case, the petitioner had taken cotton knitted shirts and sewn, with a single thread, a 10 ½ inch piece of fabric to the hem of the shirt.  The piece of fabric could be easily removed by removing the single thread.  At the time the garments were seized, the petitioner was in the process of removing the strips of fabric material.  The purpose of adding the strip of fabric was to change the classification of the garments from shirts to dresses.  Customs found that “the commercial reality of the merchandise is as a shirt disguised as a dress at the time of importation.”  Customs further noted that the pieces of the garments did not remain together up until the time of the their sale to U.S. merchants. \r\rIn HQ 222146, dated June 6, 1990, microscopes made in the German Democratic Republic (G.D.R.) were admitted into a foreign trade zone (FTZ) in St. Louis, Missouri.  The microscopes were equipped to handle the addition of a camera.  In the FTZ, each microscope was packaged with a camera. This was accomplished by physically opening each crate containing a microscope and inserting into the crate a packaged camera.  Following the initial entry for consumption the camera was removed from the microscope-camera combination and returned to the FTZ in domestic status where it was again packaged with another microscope and reentered for consumption from the FTZ.  Customs concluded that this action was a fraud or artifice, and not legitimate tariff engineering.  \r\rIn HQ 089090, dated July 10, 1991, Customs reclassified articles that had been entered as feather dusters under subheading 9603.90.4000, HTSUSA, as feathers under subheading 0505.90.0040, HTSUSA.  In making this determination, Customs concluded that the feather dusters were not constructed in the manner that feather dusters are usually constructed.  Significantly, Customs noted that after importation the feather dusters were disassembled and the feathers further processed.  This involved cleaning, sorting, bleaching and sometimes dyeing.  After processing the feathers were manufactured into articles such as headwear, boas and novelty items, or sold as feathers.  The feather dusters were not entered into the stream of commerce in the condition as imported.\r\rIn HQ 073219, dated February 29, 1984, Customs classified what was referred to by the importer as a “body suit.”  In that case, the submitted sample was a long sleeve knit sweater with a three-inch rib waist.  On the inside of the waistband, a knit crotch brief with snap closure was attached to the sweater by means of a single yarn.  The yarn was easily removed by cutting it and pulling it out, thus separating the two garments.  Customs concluded that:\r\rWe do not believe that the submitted sample is known in the commerce of the United States as a body suit or that the two joined garments are used in this country as a single garment.  Accordingly, the two garments are separately classifiable.\r\r\tIn HQ 076411, dated July 31, 1986, Customs classified a pair of overalls.  In that case, Customs found that the “bib addition to [the] garment is an unusual element having no apparent actual utility nor commercial reality.  The bib feature is obviously not intended to be used with the shorts.  Rather, the purchaser of the garment would cut off the bib at its attachment at the inner bottom of the waistband and throw it away.”  \r\rAll of these cases have a common thread running throughout them.  That is, the good is altered prior to importation, typically by adding a component, in order to receive a lower duty rate.  After importation the good is returned to its original condition and then entered into the stream of commerce.  As a result, Customs found that the goods, in their condition as imported, were not a commercial reality.  In each of these cases the importer was literally trying to deceive Customs regarding the nature of the imported goods.  These cases are distinguishable from the instant case where there is no apparent deceit as to the nature of the slippers.  They are imported and then sold with the textile soling material intact.  Indeed, the textile material cannot be removed.  Although the material may <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> off in a relatively short period of time, the ultimate purchaser cannot remove the textile and will, in fact, <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> the slipper with the textile material.  The slipper is not only introduced into the stream of commerce as entered, but it is a commercial reality, in its condition as entered. \r\rA finding that this is acceptable tariff engineering is consistent with prior rulings in which importers have altered a shoe’s composition in order to benefit from a lower duty rate.  For example, Customs has allowed an importer to add metal weights to shoes to achieve a favorable rate of duty.  See Port Ruling Letter D85216, dated December 1, 1998 (classifying a dance shoe under a 37-1/2% ad valorem duty rate provision) and NY E81498, dated May 10, 1999 (classifying a metal-weighted modified version of the same dance shoe under a 10% duty rate provision).  Although it would appear that the addition of a metal weight to a dance shoe would have questionable commercial purpose, the weighted shoe was a commercial reality. \r\rAccordingly, after consideration of the Petition and the comments, Customs finds that the constituent material of the outer sole of the subject slipper is the textile material.  Moreover, Customs finds that the addition of the textile material in order to obtain a lower duty rate constitutes legitimate tariff engineering and is not a fraud or artifice.  The slippers are classified in subheading 6405.20.90, HTSUSA, as “Other footwear: With uppers of textile materials: Other,” which has a general column one rate of duty of 12.5 percent ad valorem.   \r\r\r\r\r\rHOLDING: \r\rThe slippers are classified in subheading 6405.20.90, HTSUSA, which provides for “Other footwear: With uppers of textile materials: Other,” which has a general column one rate of duty of 12.5 percent ad valorem.   \r\rPursuant to section 175.23, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 175.23), if you are dissatisfied with this decision, you may, in accordance with section 516, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1516) file, not later than 30 days of the date of this ruling, a notice informing Customs that you wish to contest the classification of the merchandise.  The notice must designate the port or ports at which the subject merchandise is being imported into the United States, and at which port you desire to protest Customs classification.  Pursuant to 175.24, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 175.24), upon receipt of a properly filed notice contesting this decision, a notice of this decision shall be published in the Federal Register and the Customs Bulletin.\r\rSincerely, \r\r\r\rMyles B.

"{""text"":""\r\r\r\r\rHQ H249753\rApril 15, 2015\r\r\rCLA-2 OT: RR: CTF: TCM H249753 ERB\r\rCATEGORY: \tClassification\r\rTARIFF NO.: \t8711.90.00\r\rMr. Michael G. Hodes\rHodes Keating & Pilon\r134 North LaSalle Street, Suite 1300\rChicago, Illinois 60602\r\rRE: \tRequest for Reconsideration of NY N243331; Tariff classification of an electric dirt bike\r\r\rDear Mr. Hodes: \r\rThis is in response to your letter dated September 20, 2013, on behalf of your client Dynacraft BSC, Inc. (Dynacraft), requesting the reconsideration of New York Ruling Letter (NY) N243331, issued on July 18, 2013. In NY N243331, CBP ruled that an electric dirt bike was classified in heading 8711, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for motorcycles. You request classification in heading 9503, HTSUS, which provides for tricycles, scooters, pedal cars and similar wheeled toys, and argue that the ruling was issued in error and is not in accord with the current view of CBP. Our response follows herein. \r\rFACTS: \r\rNY N243331 provides as follows: \r\rThe item under consideration has been identified as an electric dirt bike, model 8801-23, “Avigo Extreme Dirt Bike.” The Aviago [sic] is powered by a 24 volt 250 watt electric motor and transports a total of 140 lbs. The applicable subheading for the Avigo Extreme Dirt Bike will be 8711.90.0000, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for Motorcycles (including mopeds) and cycles fitted with an auxiliary motor, with or without side-cars; side-cars: Other. The rate of duty will be Free. \r\rISSUE:\r\rWhether the instant electric dirt bike is classified as a motorcycle, under heading 8711, HTSUS, or as a wheeled toy, under heading 9503, HTSUS. \rLAW AND ANALYSIS: \r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUS is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI). GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the heading of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes. In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 may then be applied in order. \r\rThe HTSUS provisions at issue are as follows: \r\r8711\tMotorcycles (including mopeds) and cycles fitted with an auxiliary motor, with or without side-cars; side cars: \r\r***\r\r9503\tTricycles, scooters, pedal cars and similar wheeled toys; dolls’ carriages; dolls, other toys; reduced-scale (“scale”) models and similar recreational models, working or not; puzzles of all kinds; parts and accessories thereof: \r\rNote 1 to Section XVII, which covers Chapter 87 states: \r\rThis section does not cover articles of heading 9503… \r\rThus, if an article is found to be classified in heading 9503, HTSUS, it is excluded from classification in Section XVII, specifically, chapter 87. \r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs), constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level. While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the headings. See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). \r\rThe EN 87.11 states: \r\rThis heading covers a group of two-wheeled motorised vehicles which are essentially designed for carrying persons. \r\rIn addition to motorcycles of the conventional type, the heading includes motor-scooters, characterised by their small wheels and by a horizontal platform which joins the front and rear portions of the vehicle; moped, equipped with both a built-in engine and a pedal system; and cycles fitted with an auxiliary motor. \r\rThis heading also covers two-wheeled, electrically-powered transportation devices, designed for carrying a single person, for use within low speed areas such as pavements (sidewalks), paths, and bicycle lanes….\r\rThe EN 95.03 states: \r\rThis heading covers: \r\r(A). Wheeled toys. \r\rThese articles are usually designed for propulsion either by means of pedals, hand levers or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or rod, or, as in the case of certain scooters, by direct pressure of a person’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against the ground. Other types of wheeled toys may be simply drawn or pushed by another person or driven by a motor. \r\rThese toys include: \r\rChildren’s tricycles and the like, but excluding bicycles of heading 87.12.\rTwo- or three-wheeled scooters designed to be ridden by children, as well as youngsters and adults, with an adjustable or non-adjustable steering column and small solid or inflatable wheels. They are sometimes equipped with a bicycle-type handle-bar, a hand brake or a <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> brake on the rear wheel. \r***\r\rAnd it continues: \r\r(D) Other toys. \r\rThis group covers toys intended essentially for the amusement of persons (children or adults)….\r\rThe Court of International Trade (CIT) opined on the wheeled toy provisions of heading 9503, HTSUS, in its decision in Streetsurfing LLC. v. United States, 11 F. Supp. 3d 1287 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2014).  There, the CIT noted that heading 9503, HTSUS is a principal use provision. Principal use provisions are governed by the HTSUS Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1, which states in part that “a classification controlled by use (other than actual use) is to be determined in accordance with the use in the United States, at, or immediately prior to, the date of importation, of goods of that class or kind to which the imported goods belong, and the controlling use is the principal use.” See also HQ H233999, dated March 7, 2013 (classifying a Doodle Buddy). \r\rThe language of the heading text, as well as the language of the ENs to 95.03 are clear that articles classified therein are done so because they are “toys”. Classification as a toy under heading 9503, HTSUS, requires that the article be principally used as a toy for amusement and should not serve a utilitarian purpose. See StoreWALL, LLC. V. United States, 644 F.3d 1358, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Toys have been found to include “articles whose principal use is amusement, diversion, or play, rather than practicality.” Processed Plastic Co. v. United States, 473 F.3d 1164, 1169 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting Minnetonka Brands, Inc. v. United States, 24 CIT 645, 110 F. Supp. 2d 1020 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2000). See also HQ H236028, dated December 31, 2013 (classifying an Aquadoodle product as a “toy”). \r\rThe CIT also acknowledged in Streetsurfing LLC v. United States, 11 F. Supp. 3d 1287, 1295 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2014) the following: \r\r[T]h[is] court is mindful that in Processed Plastics the Federal Circuit found that “wheeled toys” under HTSUS Heading 9503 must be principally used for amusement, [but] the Explanatory Note accompanying this heading makes clear that the provision is narrower than plaintiff claims. That is, Heading 9503 does not cover every item with wheels that is principally used for amusement…Rather, the Explanatory Notes indicate that, in additional to being principally used for amusement, a wheeled toy properly classifiable under HTSUS heading 9503 is also characterized by other common features.\r\rUltimately, the court applied the ENs to the subject waveboards at issue there, and held that a wheeled toy under heading 9503 is characterized by the following features: (1) the absence of a training requirement prior to its use; (2)  the absence of a meaningful risk of injury involved in its use; (3) the lack of acquired skill to fully utilize the item; (4) the lack of exercise or athletic aspect in the item’s use; and (5) the presence of an assistive device. Streetsurfing LLC v. United States, 11 F. Supp. 3d 1287, 1296-98 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2014). These five enumerated characteristics of “wheeled toys” are persuasive and relevant here, insofar as they elaborate on the possible scope of heading 9503, HTSUS.  \r\rThe subject merchandise has a 250 watt motor powered by a 24-volt rechargeable battery. The dirt bike can support a maximum weight of 140 pounds (lbs) and attains a top speed of 14-miles per hour (mph). The dirt bike itself weighs 59 lbs. It also features a hand twist throttle, a rear friction brake and several bright decals to “create a fantasy dirt bike riding experience.” Dynacraft reasons that because the subject dirt bikes are a smaller scale dirt bike as compared to those for adults, and because of the limited speed, power, seat height, and weight capacity, as compared to a dirt bike for adults, then it is principally used for amusement, and is prima facie classifiable only under heading 9503, HTSUS. Put another way, Dynacraft asserts that “children will enjoy pretending to be on a real dirt bike.” But this reasoning side-steps that children will actually be riding on a dirt bike, capable of moving at high speeds, presenting a demonstrable risk of injury. It is thus, just like a “real” dirt bike. Further, “a “junior edition” of a larger, more expensive article is classifiable under the same provision as the more expensive article, if the cheaper article performs the same function on a smaller scale.” See New York Merchandise Co. v. United States, 62 Cust. Ct. 38, 40 (Cust. Ct. 1969). \r\rThe dirt bike requires coordination of a user’s balance, steering, and propulsion in unison, as well as a knowledge and understanding of a hand twist throttle and rear friction brakes. Thus, users require training prior to using the product and acquire a skill in the process. The dirt bike is capable of going up to 14 mph. The instruction manual and safety instructions that come with this product are extensive. Dynacraft highly recommends users <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> a helmet, as well as strongly urging parental supervision during use. Specifically, the safety manual states: \r\rThe age grade for the electric dirt bike is for ages 14 and older. Just because someone is within the age and weight limitations specified for the electric dirt bike, does not mean that his/her size is appropriate to fit or maintain control of the electric dirt bike or that he/she is capable of safely operating the electric dirt bike. You are the best judge of whether you or your child is at the appropriate developmental stage for safe use of the electric dirt bike….A parent’s decision to allow their child to use the electric dirt bike should be based on the child’s maturity, skill and their ability to follow rules. \r\rThus, there is a demonstrable risk of injury to users here. It is unclear if the dirt bike would provide exercise to a user, and insofar as the dirt bike has an assistive device by means of its motor, the subject motor is more powerful than motors in wheeled articles which CBP previously classified as “wheeled toys.” See NY N222337, dated July 11, 2012 (classifying an Avigo Electric Scooter which has a 12V rechargeable battery and can go up to 10 mph). \r\rAs the CIT noted, all articles listed as wheeled toys are propelled “by means of pedals, hand levers or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or rod, … by direct pressure of a person’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against het ground,” or by “simply [being] drawn or pushed by another person or driven by a motor.” See Streetsurfer LLC, supra, at 1295, citing EN 95.03. Overall, the subject dirt bikes fall outside the scope of a “wheeled toy” pursuant to the framework crafted by the CIT. As such, the exclusionary language in Note 1 to Section XVI, which includes Chapter 87 does not apply. \r\rDynacraft argues that the scale, price, and place of sale (e.g. toy stores) means the goods are classified as “toys,” and points to various CBP rulings to bolster this point.  But the subject dirt bikes are not mere playthings. They are of sufficient size and weight such that they may be used for the utilitarian purpose of transportation, especially because they are primarily used by teens and young adults. The dirt bike is fully functional in all the same meaningful ways as a dirt bike designed for an adult. Thus, as the product is powered by a 24 volt 250 watt electric motor, the subject electric dirt bike is described by heading 8711, HTSUS. \r\rHOLDING:\r\rBy application of GRI 1, the subject merchandise is properly classified under heading 8711, HTSUS. It is specifically provided for in subheading 8711.90.00, HTSUS, as “Motorcycles (including mopeds) and cycles fitted with an auxiliary motor; with or without side-cars; side-cars: Other.” The general column one rate of duty is free. \r\rNY N243331 is thus AFFIRMED. \r\rDuty rate are provided for your convenience and subject to change.

Samples were submitted for\r            examination.\r\r            FACTS:\r\r                 The manufacturing process for the footwear protectors is\r            explained as follows:\r\r                 . . . footwear protectors are incorporated into boots and\r                 shoes manufactured with a welt construction or boots and\r                 shoes manufactured with an injection molding process.\r                 With respect to welted footwear, the protectors are\r                 placed on a fabric lined last.  Subsequently, each upper\r                 is constructed around the footwear protector.\r                 Thereafter, the footwear's outersole is welted to the\r                 upper to form the finished boot or shoe.\r\r                 With respect to injection molded footwear, the footwear\r                 protector is placed in the portion of the mold that forms\r                 the footwear's upper.  Thereafter, the rubber/plastic\r                 compound is injected into the mold to form a shoe or boot\r                 whose upper incorporates the steel protector.\r\r                 It is your opinion that these footwear protectors are\r            classifiable under subheading 7326.90.90, Harmonized Tariff\r            Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA), as other\r            articles of iron or steel, other, with duty at the rate of 5.7\r            percent ad valorem.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 2 -\r\r\r                 Our St. Albans office takes the position that this\r            merchandise is properly classifiable under subheading\r            6406.99.90, HTSUSA, as parts of footwear, other, of other\r            materials, other, with duty at the rate of 18 percent ad\r            valorem.\r\r            ISSUE:\r\r                 Are the steel footwear protectors considered parts for\r            tariff purposes?\r\r            LAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r                 You assert that these protectors cannot be classified\r            under Heading 6406, HTSUSA, because they are not \""parts\"" of\r            footwear.  You cite the legal principle that \""an article is a\r            'part' if that article is an integral component of the\r            finished product, without which the finished product could not\r            function as intended.\""  You assert that following this\r            principle the protectors could not be considered parts because\r            they are not integral to the boots or shoes to which they are\r            added.  Specifically, shoes incorporating the protectors are\r            complete articles without the protectors and are capable of\r            performing all of their required functions without the\r            protectors.\r\r                 You maintain that Customs has mistakenly assumed that the\r            protectors are toe caps.  In support of this position you\r            state that The Dictionary of Shoe Industry Terminology,\r            Footwear Industries of America (1986) defines the term \""toe\r            cap\"" as \""[a]n upper section [of the footwear] extending\r            forwards from the vamp to which it is attached (stitched-on\r            cap) or imitated by a seam across a whole-vamp (imitation or\r            mock cap).\""  You assert that the footwear protectors are not\r            encompassed within this definition for the following reasons:\r\r                 1.     the footwear protectors are not \""attached\"" to the\r                        upper as that word is used in the definition;\r\r                 2.     the toe protectors are not a component formed by a\r                        seam across the vamp and thus they are not a mock\r                        toe cap;\r\r                 3.     toe caps are generally part of the exterior\r                        surface area of the upper whereas the footwear\r                        protectors are an accessory completely enveloped\r                        by the material of the upper; and\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 3 -\r\r\r                 4.     a boot or shoe without a toe cap would be\r                        incomplete, but a boot or shoe without a steel\r                        protector is a complete article of commerce that\r                        performs all functions required of footwear.\r\r                 You assert that the difference between toe protectors and\r            toe caps is not just a question of semantics.  The Explanatory\r            Notes (EN) to Heading 6406, HTSUSA, lists toe caps as an\r            exemplar of footwear parts.  Further, Note 2 to Chapter 64,\r            HTSUSA, provides in part that \""the expression 'parts' does not\r            include . . . boot protectors . . . .\""  Thus, you argue that\r            if the articles in issue are not toe caps, but footwear\r            protectors similar to \""boot protectors\"" referenced in Note 2\r            above, one must agree that the footwear protectors are\r            excluded from classification under subheading 6406.99.90,\r            HTSUSA.\r\r                 The EN to Heading 73.26, HTSUSA, states that boot or shoe\r            protectors are included within this Heading.  Consequently,\r            you urge classification under subheading 7326.90.90, HTSUSA,\r            because it squares with the intent of the drafters of the\r            Harmonized System.\r\r                 You indicate that you have been advised that all other\r            countries importing these footwear protectors classify them\r            under Heading 7326.  You suggest that Customs classify the\r            protectors in the same manner in order to be consistent with\r            the decision of other Customs Services.\r\r                                     FUNCTIONALITY\r\r                 The statement that \""[t]he boots . . . are perfectly\r            capable of performing all of their required functions without\r            the protectors\"" is patently false.  An important function of\r            the completed boots is to keep the wearer's toes from being\r            crushed by heavy objects.  Months of pain and loss of work\r            while the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> heals are obviously unpopular both with wearers\r            and with employers.  Boots with steel toes, due to the extra\r            weight and cost, are used only on footwear worn where broken\r            toes are a real possibility.  The steel toes in those\r            situations are \""required\"" either by law or by common sense.\r            It is true that the boot would perform most of its functions\r            as footwear without the insertion of the steel toes, just as\r            automobiles will perform most of their \""transportation\""\r            functions without seat belts.  However, it is obvious to us\r            that seat belts imported by Ford, for example, to be bolted to\r            their car frames are auto parts.  Likewise, these steel toe\r            caps, which cannot be removed from the boot without destroying\r            it, are shoe parts.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                         - 4 -\r\r\r                                        PARTS\r\r                 Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(c), HTSUSA,\r            provides that \""a provision for parts of an article covers\r            products solely or principally used as a part of such articles\r            but a provision for 'parts' or 'parts and accessories' shall\r            not prevail over a specific provision for such part or\r            accessory;\""\r\r                 It is apparent to us that the general class of protective\r            steel toe caps are covered by the above quoted definition of\r            \""parts\"" because they are not just \""principally\"" but \""solely\""\r            used by footwear makers as a part of a finished boot or shoe.\r            Due to their shape, as a toe cap, there is no use for them\r            other than in footwear, and they will not be purchased\r            separately by the consumer since he will not be able to insert\r            them between the upper and its lining.

A sample article was\rsubmitted to this office for review.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     You classified the items under subheading 6702.90.6500,\rHarmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated\r(HTSUSA), the provision for \""Artificial flowers, foliage and\rfruit and parts thereof; articles made of artificial flowers,\rfoliage or fruit: Of other materials: Other: Other,\"" with an\rapplicable duty rate of 17 percent ad valorem.\r\r     Protestant claims that the goods should be classified under\reither subheading 9505.90.9060, HTSUSA, the provision for\r\""Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles...: Other:\rOther, Other,\"" with an applicable duty rate of 3.1 percent ad\rvalorem; or subheading 6702.10.2000, HTSUSA, the provision for\r\""Artificial flowers, foliage and fruit and parts thereof;\rarticles made of artificial flowers, foliage or fruit: Of\rplastics: Assembled by binding with flexible materials such as\rwire, paper, textile materials, or foil, or by gluing or by\rsimilar methods,\"" with an applicable duty rate of 8.4 percent ad\rvalorem.\f                               -2-\r\r     The sample, identified by style no. F-2430, measures\rapproximately two feet in height.  (Style no. F-1820, for which\rno sample was submitted, measures approximately one <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> in\rheight.)  Each style consists of a bamboo basket which contains a\rplaster weighted base.  Embedded in the base is a wire trunk from\rwhich emanate wire branches.  The trunk and branches are wrapped\rwith plastic strips in a variety of colors.  Also included with\reach style is a small amount of plastic \""grass,\"" which is\rcomposed of plastic strip of less than 5 mm. in width.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Whether the articles are classified in subheading\r9505.90.9060, HTSUSA, as festive articles; in subheading\r6702.10.2000, HTSUSA, as artificial foliage of plastics; or in\rsubheading 6702.90.6500, HTSUSA, as artificial foliage of other\rmaterials.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification under the HTSUS is made in accordance with\rthe General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  The systematic\rdetail of the harmonized system is such that virtually all goods\rare classified by application of GRI 1, that is, according to the\rterms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative\rSection or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be\rclassified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and\rlegal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then\rbe applied.  The Explanatory Notes (ENs) to the Harmonized\rCommodity Description and Coding System, which represent the\rofficial interpretation of the tariff at the international level,\rfacilitate classification under the HTSUS by offering guidance in\runderstanding the scope of the headings and GRIs.\r\r     Heading 9505, HTSUS, provides for, among other items,\rfestive, carnival or other entertainment articles.  The ENs to\rheading 9505 state, in part, that the heading covers:\r\r     (A) Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles, which\r     in view of their intended use are generally made of non-\r     durable material.  They include:\r\r          (1) Decorations such as festoons, garlands, Chinese\r          lanterns, etc., as well as various decorative articles\r          made of paper, metal foil, glass fibre, etc., for\r          Christmas trees (e.g., tinsel, stars, icicles),\r          artificial snow, coloured balls, bells, lanterns, etc. \r          Cake and other decorations (e.g., animals, flags) which\r          are traditionally associated with a particular festival\r          are also classified here.\f                               -3-\r\r     In general, merchandise is classifiable in heading 9505,\rHTSUS, as a festive article when the article, as a whole:\r\r     1.   is of non-durable material or, generally, is not\r          purchased because of its extreme worth, or intrinsic\r          value (e.g., paper, cardboard, metal foil, glass fiber,\r          plastic, wood);\r\r     2.   functions primarily as a decoration (e.g., its primary\r          function is not utilitarian); and\r\r     3.   is traditionally associated or used with a particular\r          festival (e.g., stockings and tree ornaments for\r          Christmas, decorative eggs for Easter).\r\r     An article's satisfaction of these three criteria is\rindicative of classification as a festive article.  The motif of\ran item is not dispositive of its classification and,\rconsequently, does not transform an item into a festive article.\r\r     We consider the \""Easter trees\"" to be made of non-durable\rmaterial (since they are not designed for sustained <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and\rtear, nor are they purchased because of their extreme worth or\rvalue).  The items are also primarily decorative in function.\r\r     With respect to the third criterion, however, we find that\r\""Easter trees\"" - unlike decorative Easter eggs - are not\rtraditionally associated with Easter.  They are not the same\rtypes of articles cited in the ENs as examples of traditional,\rfestive articles.  In light of the above, the items are not\rclassified under heading 9505, HTSUS, and must be classified\relsewhere.\r\r     Among other items, heading 6702, HTSUS, provides for\rartificial foliage.  The American College Dictionary (1970),\rdefines \""foliage\"" in pertinent part as \""3. the representation of\rleaves, flowers, and branches in architectural ornament, etc.\"" \rSubheading 6702.10, HTSUS, covers artificial foliage of plastics,\rwhile subheading 6702.90, covers artificial foliage of other\rmaterials.  As noted above, several diverse materials comprise\rthe \""Easter trees,\"" (i.e., the bamboo basket, plaster base, wire,\rplastic strip, and plastic \""grass\"").  Although the plastic\r\""grass\"" and plastic which wraps the wires is highly visible, it\ramounts to only a small fraction of the weight and value of each\rentire article.  It would be inaccurate to classify the articles\ras artificial foliage of plastics.  We thus find that the \""Easter\rtrees\"" are classified in subheading 6702.90.6500, HTSUSA, as\rartificial foliage of materials other than plastics, and other\rthan feathers and man-made fibers.\f                               -4-\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The \""Easter tree\"" articles, identified by style nos.

The systematic\rdetail of the harmonized system is such that virtually all goods\rare classified by application of GRI 1, that is, according to the\rterms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative\rSection or Chapter Notes.

The EN to\rheading 9505 states, in part, that the heading covers:\r\r     (A) Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles, which\r     in view of their intended use are generally made of non-durable material.  They include:\r\r          (1) Decorations such as festoons, garlands, Chinese\r          lanterns, etc., as well as various decorative articles\r          made of paper, metal foil, glass fibre, etc., for\r          Christmas trees (e.g., tinsel, stars, icicles),\r          artificial snow, coloured balls, bells, lanterns, etc. \r          Cake and other decorations (e.g., animals, flags) which\r          are traditionally associated with a particular festival\r                    are also classified here.\f                               -3-\r\r     In general, merchandise is classifiable in heading 9505,\rHTSUS, as a festive article when the article, as a whole:\r\r     1.   is of non-durable material or, generally, is not\r          purchased because of its extreme worth, or intrinsic\r          value (e.g., paper, cardboard, metal foil, glass fiber,\r          plastic, wood);\r\r     2.   functions primarily as a decoration (e.g., its primary\r          function is not utilitarian); and\r\r     3.   is traditionally associated or used with a particular\r          festival (e.g., stockings and tree ornaments for\r          Christmas, decorative eggs for Easter).\r\r     An article's satisfaction of these three criteria is\rindicative of classification as a festive article.  The motif of\ran item is not dispositive of its classification and,\rconsequently, does not transform an item into a festive article.\r\r     The subject garlands are made of non-durable material.  We\rconsider articles such as these to be made of non-durable\rmaterial, since they are not designed for sustained <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and\rtear, and are not purchased for their extreme worth or value (as\rwould be decorative, yet costly pieces of art or crystal).  In\raddition, their primary function is decorative, as opposed to\rutilitarian.  Upon examination of the third criterion, however,\rand despite the sample product's name, we do not find these to be\rthe type of items traditionally associated with a particular\rfestival, such as Christmas.  Although it is Customs position\rthat certain types of garlands may be classified as traditional,\rfestive articles (See Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL) 950999,\rissued April 16, 1992, concerning Christmas garlands), we find\rthat the metallized plastic garlands' failure to satisfy the\rthird criterion indicates that their classification as festive\rarticles is not appropriate.  In light of their decorative aspect\rand non-durability, however, classification as other\rentertainment articles in heading 9505, may be indicated.  \r\r     In HRL 953062, issued March 8, 1993, this office classified\ran article identified as a \""paper wired plaid garland\"" as an\rother entertainment article in subheading 9505.90.40, HTSUS.  The\ritem was described as being red, green, yellow, black, and brown\rin color, having wire enclosed within the paper on its borders,\rand measuring 2-1/4 inches in width by 8 feet in length.  In HRL\r957432, issued January 12, 1995, an article identified as an\r\""Easter garland foil ribbon,\"" was also classified in subheading\f                               -4-\r\r9505.90.40, HTSUS.

A sample was\rsubmitted for examination.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The sample boot designated on the invoice as a \""6 eyelet\rleather Bean boot\"" is commonly called a \""Trader Bay Hiker.\""\rThe sole and lower portion of the high top boot are molded from\rrubber [duck bottom] and stitched to the remaining upper portion\rwhich has an external surface area of textile and leather\roverlaying textile material.  The protestant indicates that\rleather exterior covers approximately 90-92% of the interior\rmaterials leaving only a small area, approximately 8-10%, of the\router textile portion of the interior lining revealed. \r\r     The entries covering these hiking boots were liquidated\runder subheading  6402.91.50, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the\rUnited States (HTSUS), as other footwear with outer soles and\ruppers of rubber or plastics, other footwear, covering the ankle,\rother, footwear designed to be worn over, or in lieu of, other\rfootwear as a protection against water, oil, grease or chemicals\ror cold or inclement weather.  The applicable rate of duty for\rthis provision is 37.5% ad valorem.\r\r\r\r\r                               -2-\r\r     The protestant maintains that the hiking boots are properly\rclassifiable under subheading 6403.91.60, HTSUS, as footwear with\router soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather\rand uppers of leather, other footwear, covering the ankle, other,\rfor men, youths and boys.  The applicable rate of duty for this\rprovision is 8.5% ad valorem.\r\r     In the alternative protestant suggests that the hiking boots\rare classifiable under subheading 6404.11.20, HTSUS, as footwear\rwith outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition\rleather and uppers of textile materials, footwear with outer\rsoles of rubber or plastics, sports footwear, tennis shoes,\rbasketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like, having\ruppers of which over 50 percent of the external surface area\r(including any leather accessories or reinforcements such as\rthose mentioned in note 4(a) to this chapter) is leather.  The\rapplicable rate of duty for this provision is 10.5% ad valorem.\r\r     If the hiking boots are not classified as claimed above,\rprotestant asserts another alternative claim that they are\rclassifiable under subheading 6404.19.15, HTSUS, as footwear with\router soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather\rand uppers of textile materials, footwear with outer soles of\rrubber or plastics, other, footwear having uppers of which over\r50 percent of the external surface area (including any leather\raccessories or reinforcements such as those mentioned in note\r4(a) to this chapter is leather.  The applicable rate of duty for\rthis provision is 10.5% ad valorem. \r \rISSUE:\r\r     Are the leather pieces overlaying the textile material of\rthe upper considered accessories or reinforcements within the\rpurview of note 4(a) to Chapter 64?\r\r     What is the constituent material which comprises the\rgreatest external surface area of the boot's upper?\r\r     Are the hiking boots considered \""athletic footwear\"" for\rpurposes of classification under subheading 6404.11.20, HTSUS?\r\r     Is the provision for protective footwear in subheading\r6404.19.20, HTSUS, considered more specific for the hiking boots\rinvolved than the provision containing a physical description of\rmerchandise set forth in subheading 6404.19.15, HTSUS? \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                               -3-\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUS is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRI's).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, and, provided\rsuch headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to\r[the remaining GRI's taken in order].\""  In other words,\rclassification is governed first by the terms of the headings of\rthe tariff and any relative section or chapter notes.  GRI 6,\rHTSUS, requires that the GRI's be applied at the subheading level\ron the understanding that only subheadings at the same level are\rcomparable.  The GRI's apply in the same manner when comparing\rsubheadings within a heading.\r\r     Note 4(a) to Chapter 64, HTSUS, reads as follows:\r\r          The material of the upper shall be taken to be the\r          constituent material having the greatest external\r          surface area, no account being taken of accessories or\r          reinforcements such as ankle patches, edging,\r          ornamentation, buckles, tabs, eyelet stays or similar\r          attachments.\r\r     The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System\rExplanatory Notes (EN) to the HTSUS, although not dispositive\rshould be looked to for the proper interpretation of the HTSUS. \rSee 54 FR 35128 (August 23, 1989).  General EN (D) to Chapter 64,\rwhich is relevant here, reads in pertinent part as follows:\r\r     If the upper consists of two or more materials,\r     classification is determined by the constituent material\r     which has the greatest external surface area, no account\r     being taken of accessories or reinforcements such as ankle\r     patches, protective or ornamental strips or edging, other\r     ornamentation (e.g., tassels, pompons or braid), buckles,\r     tabs, eyelet stays, laces or slide fasteners.\r\r     Your classification of the hiking boot was based on a\rmeasurement of the external surface area of the boot's upper\r(ESAU) by a Sears' laboratory.  The results of that measurement\rare listed as follows:\r\r                  With Overlays            Without Overlays\r\rLeather           51.1%                    33.5%\r\rRubber            43.8%                    42.1%\r\rTextile           5.1%                     24.4% \r\r\r                               -4-\r\r     Protestant asserts that it can be deduced from the above\rmeasurements that the exterior leather around the ankle collar\rand the pieced leather portions on either side of the boot were\rincorrectly excluded as ESAU and with their addition the ESAU\rwould be 51.1% leather which would result in classification of\rthe boot under subheading 6403.91.60, HTSUS.\r\r     Protestant maintains that the leather areas excluded by\rCustoms are not accessories or reinforcements as defined in the \rEN's or chapter notes and should not be included in the\rmeasurement of the ESAU.  Further, the examples of accessories\rand reinforcements set forth in Note 4(a) to Chapter 64, HTSUS,\rsupra, and General EN (D) are additions to an already completed\rboot that are added for style or reinforcement purposes. The\rleather in the hiking boot is essential for the design of the\rboot for without it the boot would not be complete.  Clearly, the\rleather here does not possess the characteristics of the examples\rof accessories or reinforcements nor does it meet the common\rmeaning of the terms \""accessories and reinforcements.\""\r \r     Customs has taken the position that the term \""accessories or\rreinforcements,\"" although not fully defined, includes any\radditional material added to an otherwise completed upper as long\ras the underlying material is a plausible upper material, even if\rnot the best material.  While we agree that the leather overlays\rare not accessories, we do not agree with protestant's contention\rthat they are not reinforcements.  Protestant defines the term\r\""reinforcement\"" as an augmentation or addition of strength to\rsomething that has a pre-existing strength.  Thus, with the boot\rin issue, the ankle would have little or no support without the\rleather, and consequently, the leather is not a reinforcement but\rit is the prime source of support to the ankle.  We agree with\rprotestant's definition of the term \""reinforcement\"".  However, in\rthis case the upper without the leather overlays [Thinsulate\rmaterial, consisting of plastic foam backed by gluing on both\rsides with fabric and a plastic foam collar] is almost 3/4 inch\rthick and most certainly does provide at least minimal support\rfor the ankle.  Further, we do not agree with protestant's claim\rthat leather provides the initial support needed for the boot to\rsatisfy its designed use.  It appears that the overlayed material\rprovides the initial support to the ankle while the leather\roverlays perform a reinforcing role in augmenting the support\rprovided by the overlayed materials. \r\r     The protestant states that the textile material being an\rintegral part of the interior lining of the shoe has no effect on\rthe calculation of the ESAU.  Further, materials  of which only a\rde minimis  portion are exposed on the exterior of the upper\rshould be excluded from the calculation of the ESAU. We regard\rthe so-called interior lining material which appears as a portion\r\r\r                               -5-\r\rof the ESAU before the overlays are removed to be a plausible\rupper material.  The de minimis rule has no application here. \rThe presence of textile material on the external surface of the\rupper is not an inadvertence.  It was placed there to increase\rthe \""breathability\"" of the boot and for stylistic reasons e.g.,\rincreased salability.  Varsity Watch Company v. United States, 34\rCCPA 155, C.A.D. 359 (1947;     \rCorporacion Argentina de Productores de Carnes v. United States,\r32 CCPA 175, C.A.D. 304 9(1945).\r\r     Protestant claims that the textile material appearing on the\rexternal surface of the boot's upper is an integral part of the\rinterior lining of the shoe and has no effect on calculation of\rthe ESAU.  Further, it is claimed that the lining material is\rspecifically excluded from calculation of the ESAU by virtue of\rGeneral EN (D) to Chapter 64, HTSUS, which provides in part that\r\""[t]he constituent material of any lining has no effect on\rclassification.\""  Inasmuch as the so-called lining material\rappears as part of the external surface area of the upper [more\rthan a de minimis amount] we would not exclude it from\rcalculation of the ESAU because it is in fact plausible upper\rmaterial.\r\r     Protestant makes an alternative claim that the hiking boots\rshould be considered athletic footwear for tariff purposes and\rclassified under subheading 6404.11.20, HTSUS.  \r\r     In T.D. 92-32 (16 Cust. Bull. 4), responding to the claim of\rthe importers that the hiking/backpacking boot is classifiable as\rathletic footwear, Customs stated at page 18 the following:\r\r          In this instance the hiking/backpacking boot, although\r          used in the sport of backpacking, fails to qualify as\r          athletic footwear within subheading 6404.11 because it\r          is not \""like\"" tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym\r          shoes, and training shoes.  Specifically, hiking boots\r          are heavier than the listed exemplars of athletic\r          footwear.  This slows the wearer's running speed\r          substantially.  All the exemplars are used in sports\r          which require fast footwork or extensive running. \r          Additionally, the exemplars are not constructed so as\r          to protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against rough and rocky terrain as\r          are hiking boots.  For these reasons we conclude that\r          the hiking/backpacking boot is not classifiable under\r          subheading 6404.11, as claimed.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                               -6-\r\r     Protestant maintains that the reasons stated above for not\rconsidering hiking boots as athletic footwear are unsubstantiated\rand incorrect for the following reasons:\r\r     1.   Customs cited no evidence that hiking boots are heavier\r          than the exemplars and, if they are, that such weight\r          would be sufficient to substantially slow the wearers\r          running speed. There appears to be several high top\r          basketball shoes that weigh approximately the same or\r          even more than some hiking boots.\r\r     2.   Customs made the statement that all the exemplars are\r          used in sports that require fast footwork or extensive\r          running.  Nowhere does this qualification appear in the\r          tariff schedule or the applicable notes. There are\r          other uses, apart from running and fast footwork, for\r          the exemplars such as training shoes which are often\r          used for such athletic activities as weight lifting.\r\r     3.   Weight cannot be used as an attribute to exclude hiking\r          boots when the weight difference between the exemplars\r          is often times drastic, such as the weight difference\r          between ultra light shoes designed for long distance\r          running and sturdy high top basketball shoes.\r\r     4.   The claim by Customs that the exemplars are not\r          constructed so as to protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against rough and\r          rocky terrain does not appear to be an accurate\r          statement.  Running shoes designed for outdoor use are\r          constructed to give their wearer comfort when running\r          on rough terrain such as gravel.  Further, high top\r          basketball shoes offer the same support and protection\r          to the wearer's ankle to assist the wearer in making\r          sharp turns.\r\r     5.   Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1986)\r          defines the word \""sneaker\"" as \""3: a shoe usu. of canvas\r          with a pliable rubber sole worn esp. for sports or\r          hiking....\""  The definition of gym shoe includes shoes\r          made for hiking.  Clearly, if the common meaning of one\r          of the exemplars includes shoes used for hiking then a\r          hiking boot must be considered to be \""like\"" the\r          exemplars and be classified as athletic footwear.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                               -7-\r\r     It is our observation that hiking boots [especially the\rsample] are heavier than the listed exemplars and their weight is\rsufficient to substantially slow the wearers' running speed. \rThis is especially so when compared with the wearer's speed when\rwearing the type of footwear represented by the exemplars. \rHowever, it should be noted that weight alone is not the sole\rfactor in determining whether a shoe is athletic footwear for \rtariff purposes.  An examination of the sample reveals that it is\rnot \""like\"" the exemplars in that it differs from them in several\rsignificant respects exclusive of weight.  First, the sample boot\rhas a steel shank in its sole which is not present in any of the\rlisted exemplars.  Second, the sample boot has a waterproof \""duck\rbottom\"" which is a type of construction not found in the\rexemplars.  Third, the sample boot has a distinct heel which is\rnot present in footwear represented by the exemplars.\r\r     We agree with the protestant that there is nothing in the\rEN's or the tariff schedule which explicitly provides that all\rthe exemplars of athletic footwear are used in sports that\rrequire fast footwear or extensive running.  However, the use of\rthe term \""and the like\"" in Additional U.S. Note 2 requires us to\rmake a determination as to the type of footwear which is ejusdem\rgeneris with tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, and\rtraining shoes.  There is no doubt that the exemplars including\rtraining shoes are principally used in sports that require fast\rfootwork or extensive running.\r\r     Protestant asserts that Customs is inaccurate in its claim\rthat the exemplars are not constructed to protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>\ragainst rough and rocky terrain.  It is our view that while\rrunning shoes designed for outdoor use provide wearer comfort\rwhen running on gravel, they certainly do not provide the kind of\rprotection needed for the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> when running across rough terrain\r[not just gravel] where one encounters rocks, branches, water,\rmud, etc.  The exemplars are definitely not designed for such\ruse.\r\r      The definition of the word \""sneaker\"" cited by the\rprotestant does not persuade us that hiking boots are \""like' \""the\rexemplars.  Certainly, one can <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> sneakers for hiking but it is\ralso true that one can also <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> oxfords.  However, neither\rsneakers nor oxfords are designed for use in hiking over rough\rterrain as are hiking boots.  We note that the word \""hiking\"" as\rused in the definition can be easily equated with the word\r\""walking\"" which we believe more closely resembles reality with\rrespect to the use of \""sneakers.\""\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                               -8-\r\r     The final alternative claim by the protestant is that\rpursuant to GRI 3(a) the hiking boots are more specifically\rprovided for under subheading 6404.19.15, HTSUS, than under\rsubheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS, as footwear with outer soles of\rrubber, plastic, leather or composition leather and uppers of\rtextile materials, footwear with outer soles of rubber or\rplastics, other, footwear having uppers of which over 50 percent\rof the external surface area (including any leather accessories\ror reinforcements such as those mentioned in note 4(a) to this\rchapter) is leather.\r\r     GRI 3(a), HTSUS, which is relevant here, provides in\rpertinent part as follows:\r\r          3.   When, by application of rule 2(b) or for any other \r               reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable under\r               two or more headings, classification shall be\r               effected as follows:\r\r               (a)  The heading which provides the most specific\r                    description shall be preferred to headings\r                    providing a more general description . . .\r\r     Protestant asserts that the hiking boots could arguably be\rclassified under either subheading 6404.19.15, HTSUS, or\rsubheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS, which are equally indented\rprovisions.  However, the hiking boots are more specifically\rprovided for under subheading 6404.19.15, HTSUS, and, therefore\rpursuant to GRI 3(a) should be classified therein.  The rationale\rfor this claim is that subheading 6404.19.15, HTSUS, contains a\rrather technical surface area description covering very specific\rtypes of shoes whereas subheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS, covers any\rtype of protective shoe, which could cover a broad array of shoes\rwhose surface areas contain any numerous types of materials.\r\r     It is clear that the hiking boots are prima facie\rclassifiable under subheading 6404.19.15, HTSUS.  They are also\rprima facie classifiable under subheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS, as\rprotective footwear noting the presence of their vulcanized\rrubber <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> portions and their \""Thinsulate\"" linings.\r\r     In Headquarters Ruling Letter 086993 dated June 12, 1990,\rCustoms ruled that a combination leather and textile boot was\r\""more specifically described\"" in subheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS,\rthan under subheading 6404.19.15, HTSUS.  The rationale for this\rposition was that the provisions for protective footwear in\rsubheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS, is a use provision which is\rconsidered to be a more specific description of the footwear than\rthe physical description of the footwear in subheading\r6404.19.15, HTSUS.\r\r\r                               -9-\r\r     It has come to Customs attention that our characterization\rof the provision in subheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS, for \""[f]ootwear\rdesigned to be worn over, or in lieu of, other footwear as a\rprotection against water, oil, grease or chemicals or cold or\rinclement weather\"" as a use provision is not entirely accurate. \rIt has been suggested that the provision is more accurately\rdescribed as both a \""use\"" and \""design\"" provision.  We have agreed\rwith this suggestion and would now characterize the protective\rprovision in subheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS, as essentially a\r\""designed for use\"" provision.\r\r     Nonetheless, it remains our position that the provision for\rprotective footwear in subheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS, is more\rspecific than the provision in subheading 6404.19.15, HTSUS.  It\ris our observation that a requirement that the footwear be\rdesigned to be worn over or in lieu of other footwear for\rprotective purposes is harder to satisfy than a requirement that\rthe footwear fit a particular physical description.\r\r     In the event that the provision for protective footwear in\rsubheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS, is not considered to be a more\rspecific provision than the provision for the physically\rdescribed footwear in subheading 6404.19.15, HTSUS, we submit\rthat the two provision are equally specific.  Consequently,\rfollowing GRI 3(c), HTSUS, classification under subheading\r6404.19.20, HTSUS, is appropriate as \"" . . . the heading which\roccurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit\rconsideration.\"" \r\r     When the leather pieces were removed from the upper of the\rsample, we found that the same textile outer material that\rappears in the four spaces between the leather pieces prior to\rtheir removal, constituted all of the ESAU above the\rrubber/plastic bottom portion of the boot, with the exception of\rthe small strip of textile topline trim.  In our opinion this\rmeans that all of the leather should be considered \""accessories\ror reinforcements.\""  Therefore, using Sears' own laboratory\rreport, this boot has an ESAU, with no account being taken of\raccessories or reinforcements, of 57.9% textile and 42.1%\rrubber/plastic.  \r\r     In T.D. 92-32 Customs took the position that hiking boots\rwith GORE-TEX liners are properly classifiable as protective\rfootwear under subheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS, with duty at the\rrate of 37.5% ad valorem.  However, the effective date of that\rdetermination was delayed for 90 days from the date of\rpublication of the document in the Customs Bulletin which was\rApril 15, 1992.  Consequently, the delayed effective date of T.D.\r92-32 applies to importations made prior to July 15, 1992.  \r\r\r\r                              -10- \r\r     In a supplemental submission dated May 24, 1993, counsel for\rthe protestant asserts that the effective date of T.D. 92-32,\rJune 23, 1992, governs the effective date of the ruling in the\rinstant case, and the protest should be allowed on that basis.  \r\r     Counsel states that T.D. 92-32 covers all affected parties\rand pursuant to 19 C.F.R. 177.9(e)(3) all affected parties should\rbe afforded the effects of this delay.  In recent Headquarters's\rrulings issued subsequent to T.D 92-32, Customs took the position\rthat affected parties are those parties who have imported boots\rwhich are similar to the hiking boots in T.D. 92-32 with respect\rto their \""protective\"" qualities.  Counsel argues that because the\rboots in issue are very similar to the boots in T.D. 92-32 and\rbecause Customs has held that they have the same protective\rqualities, the effective date of T.D. 92-32 also governs the\reffective date of the instant boots which were entered for\rconsumption prior to June 23, 1992. \r\r     Counsel cites HRL's 089929 and 950202 dated April 24 and 25,\r1992, respectively, as examples of rulings in which Customs\rgranted a delayed effective date to entries of hiking boots which\rwere similar to the hiking boots ruled on in T.D. 92-32 with\rrespect to their \""protective\"" qualities. \r\r     The hiking boots which were the subject of the cited rulings\rwere similar in their \""protective\"" qualities to the hiking boots\rwhich were the subject of T.D. 92-32 in that they possessed\rwaterproof liners.  The hiking boots in issue do not derive their\r\""protective\"" qualities from waterproof liners but rather from\rtheir \""duck bottoms\"" and \""Thinsulate\"" linings.  Consequently,\rthese hiking boots cannot be said to be similar in their\r\""protective\"" qualities to the hiking boots which were the subject\rof T.D. 92-32.  Consequently, entries of the \""Trader Bay Hikers\""\rare not entitled to the delayed effective date set out in T.D.\r92-32.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The leather pieces overlaying the textile material of the\rupper of the boot are considered reinforcements within the\rmeaning of note 4(a) to Chapter 64, HTSUS.\r\r     The constituent material which comprises the greatest\rexternal surface area of the boot's upper is textile material.\r\r     Hiking boots are not considered \""athletic footwear\"" for\rpurposes of classification under subheading 6404.11.20, HTSUS.\r\r\r\r\r\r                              -11-\r\r     The provision for protective footwear in subheading\r6404.19.20, HTSUS, is considered more specific for the hiking\rboots involved than the provision containing a physical\rdescription of merchandise set forth in subheading 6404.19.15,\rHTSUS.\r     \r     The hiking boots are dutiable as liquidated at the rate of\r37.5% ad valorem under subheading 6404.19.20, HTSUS.  Inasmuch as \rthe boots' \""protective\"" features are derived from the boot's\r\""duck bottoms\"" and \""Thinsulate\"" linings rather than a waterproof\rliner, the protestant is not entitled to liquidation at the rate\rof 10.5% ad valorem prior to July 15, 1992.  See T.D. 92-32 (16\rCust. Bull. 25). \r\r     Since the rate of duty under the classification indicated\rabove is the same as the liquidated rate, the protest should be\rdenied in full.  A copy of this decision should be attached to\rthe Customs Form 19, and mailed to the protestant, through\rcounsel, as part of the notice of action on the protest.\r\r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director\r                                   Commercial Rulings Division\r\r\r \r\r\u001A\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1993/952228.doc"",""id"":8838,""rulingNumber"":""952228"",""subject"":""Protest no. 2002-92-100270;  Boots, textile and leather;     Uppers, external surface area;  Footwear, athletic;      Accessories and reinforcements; Delayed effective date;      T.D. 92-32 "",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1993-06-07T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""086993""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6404.19.20""]}"

(hereinafter “Protestant” or “Medi”), contesting U.S Customs and Border Protection’s (“CBP”) tariff classification of several styles of men’s and women’s graduated compression socks and graduated compression calf sleeves under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”).  Our decision is set forth below.\r\rProtestant has asked that certain information submitted in connection with this Protest be treated as confidential.  The request for confidentiality is approved.  The information contained within brackets in Protestant’s submission and identified attachments to the Protest, forwarded to our office, will not be released to the public.\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe merchandise at issue consists of several styles of Medi’s men’s and women’s graduated compression socks and graduated compression calf sleeves sold under the label CEP Compression (a division of Medi).  The socks include knee high socks that cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, ankle, and leg above the knee; and short socks that cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and ankle.  The calf sleeves cover the upper ankle and below the knee area.  According to Protestant, the socks and calf sleeves are constructed of knit synthetic materials and are principally “marketed to athletes and other active lifestyle consumers as part of Medi’s CEP line of performance sportswear (http://www.cepcompression.com) for maximizing performance, energy, and endurance due to improved blood circulation and for the prevention of injuries.”  Protestant further states that all of the socks and calf sleeves feature a minimum compression of 20 to 30 mm Hg, and are worn for the following reasons: \r\r[T]o: (i) counter the effects of venous disease and improve venous valve and arterial functions by facilitating blood circulation; (ii) prevent blood pooling and various types of edema, or swelling; (iii) reduce the risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis; and (iv) stabilize muscles and joints to prevent certain types of injuries (e.g., shin splints, plantar fasciitis) and increase proprioception, which refers to an individual's sense of how the body is positioned in space.\r \r\tThe graduated compression socks and graduated compression calf sleeves were entered under subheading 6115.10.0500, HTSUSA (“Annotated”), which provides for “[p]anty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins) and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins): Surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.”  The column one, general rate of duty is free.  The socks were reclassified and liquidated under subheading 6115.10.4000, HTSUSA, which provides for “[p]anty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins) and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins): Other graduated compression hosiery: Of synthetic fibers (632).”  The column one, general rate of duty is 14.6% ad valorem.  The calf sleeves were also liquidated and reclassified, but under subheading 6307.90.9889, HTSUSA, which provides for “[o]ther made up articles, including dress patterns: Other: Other: Other: Other: Other.”  The column one, general rate of duty is 7% ad valorem.\r \rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the tariff classification of the graduated compression socks and graduated compression calf sleeves? \r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tInitially, we note that the matter is protestable under 19 U.S.C. § 1514(a)(2) as a decision on classification.  The Protest was timely filed, within 180 days of liquidation of the entries.  (Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2004, Pub.L. 108-429, § 2103(2) (B) (ii), (iii) (codified as amended at 19 U.S.C. § 1514(c) (3) (2006)).\r\r      \tFurther Review of Protest No. 1512-20-100291 is properly accorded to Protestant pursuant to 19 C.F.R. § 174.24(c) because it involves matters previously ruled upon by the Commissioner of CBP or his designee or by the Customs courts, but facts are alleged, or legal arguments presented which were not considered at the time of the original ruling.  \r      \r      \tClassification under the HTSUS is determined in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (“GRIs”).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 may then be applied in order.   \r\rThe 2018 and 2019 HTSUS headings under consideration are as follows:\r \r6115:\tPanty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins) and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted:\r6115.10:\tGraduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins):\r6115.10.0500:\tSurgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment . . . \r\r\tOther graduated compression hosiery: \r\r6115.10.4000:\t\tOf synthetic fibers (632) . . . \r \r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\r6307:   \t      Other made up articles, including dress patterns: \r6307.90:\tOther:\r\r\t\t     Other:\r6307.90.98:\t\tOther . . .  \r\t\t\t     Other:\r6307.90.9889:\t\t\tOther . . .\r\r\t\t\t \r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (“ENs”) constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While not legally binding, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are thus useful in ascertaining the proper classification of merchandise.  It is CBP’s practice to follow, whenever possible, the terms of the ENs when interpreting the HTSUS.  See T.D. 89-90, 54 Fed Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rThe EN to 61.15, provides, in relevant part, as follows: \r\rThis heading covers the following knitted or crocheted goods, without distinction between those for women or girls and those for men or boys:\r\r[…]\r\r(4)   Graduated compression hosiery, e.g., stockings for varicose veins.\r\r[…]\r\rSubheading Explanatory Note.\r\u00A0\rSubheading 6115.10\r\u00A0\rFor the purposes of subheading 6115.10, “graduated compression hosiery” means hosiery in which the compression is greatest at the ankle and reduces gradually along its length up the leg, so that blood flow is encouraged.\r\rEN 63.07, provides, in pertinent part, that:\t\r\rThis heading covers made up articles of any textile material which are\u00A0not included\u00A0more specifically in other headings of Section XI or elsewhere in the Nomenclature.\r\r \t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\r\t Medi argues that the graduated compression socks and graduated compression calf sleeves are surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment classified in subheading 6115.10.0500, HTSUSA, which provides for “[p]anty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins) and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins): Surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.”  As an initial matter, we note that the question presented concerns the classification of two articles whose physical characteristics substantially differ from one another.  Whereas the compression sock consists of a closed-toe construction, the calf sleeve covers neither the ankle nor the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Because the compression socks and calf sleeves substantially differ from one another, the classification of each article must be separately addressed. \r\rInasmuch as the Medi compression socks are fully described by the terms of heading 6115, HTSUS, as graduated compression hosiery, there is no dispute that the compression socks are classified therein.  Consequently, because this matter concerns the proper classification of the merchandise in the subheadings of heading 6115, HTSUS, GRI 6 applies.  There is also no dispute at the 6-digit level that the compression socks are classified in subheading 6115.10, HTSUS, as “graduated compression hosiery.”  Instead, the issue is at the 8-digit level and concerns whether the graduate compression socks are classified in subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS, as “surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment,” or under subheading 6115.10.40, HTSUS, as “other graduated compression hosiery.”\r\rNeither the HTSUS nor the ENs define “surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.”  When a tariff term is not defined by the HTSUS or the legislative history, its correct meaning is its common, or commercial, meaning.  Rocknel Fastener, Inc. v. United States, 267 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  “To ascertain the common meaning of a term, a court may consult ‘dictionaries, scientific authorities, and other reliable information sources’ and ‘lexicographic and other materials.”  Id.  (quoting C.J. Tower & Sons of Buffalo, Inc. v. United States, 673 F.2d 1268, 1271, 69 C.C.P.A. 128 (C.C.P.A. 1982); Simod Am. Corp. v. United States, 872 F.2d 1572, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).\r\rCBP has consistently looked to the U.S. National Library of Medicine (“NLM”) at the National Institute of Health (“NIH”) for the commercial meaning of “surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.”  The NLM provides that medical-grade compression stockings are prescribed by a health care provider to treat someone who has just had surgery, or to treat someone with varicose veins or spider veins.  Compression stockings work by gently squeezing the legs to move blood up the legs and improve blood flow throughout the legs.  The stocking help with “[a]ching and heavy feeling in legs,” “[s]welling in legs,” “[p]reventing blood clots, primarily after surgery or injury when you are less active,” and “[p]reventing complications of blood clots in the legs, such as post-phlebitic syndrome (pain and swelling in the leg).”  \r\rCompression stockings provide the most pressure at the ankle and less as the stocking rises up the leg.  This is also supported by the ENs to subheading 6115.10, HTSUS, which describe compression hosiery as “hosiery in which the compression is greatest at the ankle and reduces gradually along its length up the leg, so that blood flow is encouraged.”  The NLM further states that one should get a prescription from a doctor to buy compression stockings and to “find a medical equipment store where they can measure your legs, so you get a good fit.”  Moreover, the NLM explains that there are many different compression stockings, that come in various pressures, lengths, and colors, and one should consult their doctor to determine what stocking is right for them.  National Institute of Health, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Compression Stockings, at https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000597.htm (last visited, July 29, 2021).  \r\rSimilarly, in Treasury Decision (T.D.) 76-133(3), 10 Cust B, 232 (1976), Customs offered the following description of surgical stockings:\r\rFor tariff classification purposes, a surgical stocking is a leg and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> covering which is made from a heavy gauge, opaque, elasticized fabric with either a one or two-way stretch, and which is worn, as a remedial support of the leg.  It is designed for use in post-surgical support and in the treatment of thrombophlebitis, varicosities, edema, and other physical ailments, and is sold either singly or in pairs.  It is not the type of merchandise commonly known as support hose which can be purchased in a variety of retail stores.  Surgical stockings are usually obtained at the direction of a physician at certain medical supply outlets which have personnel specialty trained to measure and fit the merchandise to the legs of each individual patient. \r\rCBP has previously considered the classification of graduated compression socks and whether or not they are surgical stockings.  In Headquarters Ruling Letter (“HQ”) H237738, dated August 17, 2016, which revoked New York Ruling Letter (“NY”) N235286, dated December 7, 2012, CBP found that the “Surgeon’s Choice” and ”Boost” style of graduated compression hosiery was properly classified in subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS, as surgical hosiery, stating the following: \r\rSpecifically, the “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost” hosieries are prescribed by physicians to prevent or treat venous disorders of the legs and feet, including blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), varicose veins, and lymphedema.  The hosieries provide graduated compression in the range of 20-30 or 30-40 mm of mercury (mm HG), and are designed to help push blood out of the legs and feet by compressing surface veins to increase arterial pressure.  Moreover, CBP observes that the “Surgeon’s Choice” and “Boost” hosieries are sold in medical and surgical supply stores, where trained personnel use detailed measurements of a patient’s leg to properly fit the stockings and socks.  \r\rSimilarly, in HQ 963517, dated January 2, 2002, CBP found that Protestant’s graduated compression panty hose and stockings were properly classified as surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment in subheadings 6115.12.1000, HTSUSA, and 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA.  The graduated compression panty hose and stockings had a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg, were “packaged and sold by prescription as part of a line of hosiery with graduated compression which ranges from 20 to 50 mm Hg . . . [and] sold through medical supply houses and similar places by professionals skilled in fitting [the] stockings.”  However, in the same case, CBP found that Protestant’s anti-embolism stockings were not surgical stockings and were classified in subheading 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA.  Specifically, when comparing the anti-embolism stockings and the other graduated compression panty hose and stockings, CBP stated, “the anti-embolism stockings are distinguishable from the stockings discussed previously in that they are available without prescription and do not require specialized fitting.”  Also, the anti-embolism stockings only had a compression of 18 mm Hg when CBP had previously established in that ruling that the minimum compression for surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression is 20-30 mm Hg. \r\rLikewise, in HQ 959399, dated December 16, 1996, CBP rejected the classification of Protestants graduated compression panty hose and stockings as “surgical compression stockings” because the merchandise supplied less than 30 mm Hg of compression, was available for purchase without prescription, and was more “fashionable” than articles properly classified as surgical compression stockings.  Also, in NY N057324, dated May 1, 2009, CBP classified athletic socks “marketed for use after intense training or competition for the purpose of revitalizing muscles in the lower legs” that are “compressed in the ankle at 15.71 mm Hg and in the calf at 21.89 mm Hg,” in subheading 6115.96.9020, HTSUSA.  CBP stated that “[t]he items in question are for more general use, and are not prescribed by a physician or fitted as specifically as surgical graduated compression pantyhose or hosiery.”  See also NY N240220, dated April 24, 2013; NY K80446, dated November 17, 2003; NY N004757, dated January 11, 2007; and NY 81986, dated February 24, 1997.\r\rBased on the aforementioned, we find that the graduated compression socks in this case are not surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment classified in subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS.  First, medical-grade compression stockings are prescribed by a doctor, and the compression stockings at issue here do not require a physician’s prescription.  Second, medical-grade compression stockings are sold in specialty stores where one’s leg must be measured and fitted by trained personnel.  They are not the type of support hose which can be purchased in a variety of retail stores.  The compression socks at issue here are sold online and in retail stores, and not do not require fitting by a trained professional.  \r\rThird, surgical panty hose and surgical stockings are designed for use post-surgery or after injury to prevent blood clots, swelling and aching, and to treat orthopedic ailments such as thrombophlebitis, varicosities, edema, spider veins, etc.  As stated by Protestant, the CEP compression socks are “marketed to athletes and other active lifestyle consumers” and designed for “maximizing performance, energy, and endurance due to improved blood circulation and for the prevention of injuries.”  This is further supported by the CEP website, under the page for Men’s compression socks, that states “CEP compression socks for men come in a number of different designs and various heights for running, skiing, basketball, tennis, and more.  Increase traction, improve circulation, and give your muscles the support and stability they need to prevent injury and decrease recovery time.”\u0002  The compression socks here are clearly designed for an active segment of the population and not for someone post-surgery or suffering from serious orthopedic ailments.  Therefore, based on the aforementioned, the graduated compression socks in this case are not classified in subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS, as surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  Instead, we find that the graduated compression socks are simply graduated compression stockings for general use or active use and are properly classified under subheading 6115.10.40, HTSUS.\r\rWith regards to Medi’s graduated compression calf sleeves, we find that because the calf sleeves do not cover a wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and ankle, the calf sleeves substantially differ from the Medi compression socks and must be classified separately.  The doctrine ejusdem generis means literally, “of the same class or kind,” and as applied to questions of classification, it requires that imported merchandise possess the essential characteristics or purposes that unite articles enumerated eo nomine in order to be classified under the general terms of an HTSUS provision. Here, the footless calf sleeves cannot be described ejusdem generis by the terms “panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery,” in heading 6115, HTSUS, because such articles are specifically designed to cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of a wearer.  \r\rHaving determined that Medi’s graduated compression calf sleeves are not described by the terms of heading 6115, HTSUS, we find that the instant calf sleeves are instead classified in heading 6307, HTSUS, as “other made up articles.”  Heading 6307, HTSUS, covers made-up articles of any textile material that are not more specifically provided for in other headings of Section XI of the HTSUS.  See EN 63.07.  Since the calf sleeves are made up textile articles not more specifically provided for elsewhere in the tariff, we find that the calf sleeves are properly classified in heading 6307, HTSUS, and specifically in subheading 6307.90.9889, HTSUSA.  We note that CBP has previously ruled on a variety of articles substantially similar to Medi’s compression calf sleeves, and in each case, has consistently classified such articles in heading 6307, HTSUS.  See HQ H262218, dated February 6, 2020; HQ H281032, dated February 6, 2017; NY N248199, dated December 12, 2013; NY N206815, dated March 20, 2012; and HQ 950470, dated January 7, 1992.\r\rMedi, however, disagrees and provides several arguments for why the graduated compression socks and graduated compression calf sleeves are classified in subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS, as surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  First, Protestant argues that subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS, is a principle use provision which they interpret to mean that the socks and calf sleeves only need to meet a minimum compression of 20 to 30 mm Hg, an “industry standard agreed by CBP for conveying orthopedic benefits,” and be principally used for orthopedic purposes as it is defined in relation to heading 9021, HTSUS.  Second, Protestant argues that CBP has incorrectly converted subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS, into an actual use provision for requiring that surgical compression stockings be prescribed by a physician and measured and fitted by trained personnel.  We disagree.  We note that the criteria for surgical compression stockings are based on its commercial meaning provided for by the NLM and T.D. 76-133(3). \r\r Furthermore, and as indicated above, CBP has previously examined classification of similar merchandise, and has found that compression strength and the use of physician prescriptions are important considerations in determining whether an article of graduated compression hosiery can be properly described as a “surgical stocking with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment” of subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS.  By contrast, CBP has consistently held that non-prescription graduated compression hosiery—identified by comparatively low compression strengths and suitable for purchase without specialty fitting—are not classifiable as “surgical” hosiery.  \r\r\tSecond, Medi argues that all of the graduated compression socks and graduated compression calf sleeves have a minimum compression of greater than 20 mm Hg.  Therefore, all of the products at issue in this Protest satisfy the minimum compression requirement for classification in subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS.  While we do not dispute the minimum compression of the socks and calf sleeves, which would support classification in subheading 6115.10, HTSUS, it is not the only criteria for classification of the graduated compression socks and compression calf sleeves as surgical stockings, and because the compression socks and calf sleeves do not meet the criteria provided for by the NLM and T.D. 76-133(3), they are not classified in subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS. \r\r \tThird, Medi argues that although their socks and calf sleeves are marketed towards an active segment of the population, they are, nevertheless, principally used for orthopedic purposes, insofar as those items are worn for the following reasons: \r\r[T]o: (i) counter the effects of venous disease and improve venous valve and arterial functions by facilitating blood circulation; (ii) prevent blood pooling and various types of edema, or swelling; (iii) reduce the risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis; and (iv) stabilize muscles and joints to prevent certain types of injuries (e.g., shin splints, plantar fasciitis) and increase proprioception, which refers to an individual's sense of how the body is positioned in space.\r\rMedi provides that while the HTSUS does not define the term “orthopedic,” it does define “orthopedic appliances” in Note 6 to Chapter 90, HTSUS, and this definition should be used to determine whether or not a product is used for orthopedic treatment.  Note 6 to Chapter 90, HTSUS, provides the following: \r\rFor the purposes of heading 9021, the expression “orthopedic appliances” means appliances for:\r\rPreventing or correcting bodily deformities; or\r\rSupporting or holding parts of the body following an illness, operation or injury.\r\rOrthopedic appliances include footwear and special insoles designed to correct orthopedic conditions, provided that they are either (1) made to measure or (2) mass-produced, entered singly and not in pairs and designed to fit either <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> equally.\r\r\tAs a result, Protestant claims that with respect to Note 6 to Chapter 90, HTSUS, the compression socks and calf sleeves are used for orthopedic treatment as they “unquestionably are employed in the prevention and correction of bodily deformities” and because they are “routinely also used to treat the effects of certain types of illness (e.g., venous disease) and to support the leg following injury.”  Thus, absent a definition of “orthopedic” in the HTSUS, Protestant argues that the term “orthopedic” cannot be limited to use in connection with illness or injury and seeks to expand the term to encompass the definition of “orthopedic appliances.”  Compression socks and calf sleeves are not “orthopedic appliances.”  Hence, the term “orthopedic appliances” defined in Note 6 to Chapter 90, HTSUS, is irrelevant to the classification of the particular products in this case. \r\rInstead, since the term “orthopedic” is not defined in the HTSUS, CBP has relied upon the common and commercial meaning of the term defined in the NLM and T.D. 76-133(3).  Again, both the NLM and T.D. 76-133(3) state that medical-grade compression stockings are prescribed by a doctor for the treatment of venous diseases or other serious medical conditions, and are sold in medical equipment stores where they can be measured to ensure a good fit.  In contrast, Medi’s compression socks have none of the qualities defined in either the NLM or T.D 76-133(3).  They do not require a prescription, they are not specially fitted by medical personnel, and are not advertised or sold for the treatment of venous diseases or other serious medical conditions.  Medi’s socks are advertised for athletes to improve performance, energy, and endurance.  While Medi claims in their Protest that their compression socks can also treat venous diseases, blood circulation, swelling, deep Vein Thrombosis, etc., these attributes cannot be compared to medical grade compression stockings that are used for serious orthopedic medical conditions and post-surgery to prevent blood clots and swelling.  Actually, Protestant makes no claim that the compression socks in this case have any nexus to surgery or post-operative care.\r\rFourth, Medi provides that there is no longer a physician prescription requirement for ready-to-<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> graduated compression garments, making the requirement outdated.  Nevertheless, Medi provides evidence that physicians routinely recommend or “prescribe” the compression socks and calf sleeves to their patients.  Again, we disagree with Protestant.  We have no evidence that surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment no longer require a physician’s prescription nor did Protestant provide any evidence that a physician prescription is no longer required for these types of surgical compression hosiery.  In fact, Sigvaris, another seller of compression socks, indicates on their website that “[c]ompression stockings with higher levels of compression are prescribed by doctors.  The prescription will include the specific strength you need.  By law, no prescription is required, but most pharmacies won’t dispense higher-level compression <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> without a prescription.”\u0002  \r\rLastly, Medi argues that the socks and calf sleeves require specialty training and fitting because they must be fitted based on the circumferential measurement of the wearers leg at the calf or ankle which ensures the proper compression.  They provide that “the measurement and fitting process is integrated into the interaction with the retail customer and is a key component of the direction a prospective purchaser receives online.  Furthermore, all CEP retailers are educated on this process and provided with tools needed to assist in this process.”  We disagree with Protestant and find that what they say is specialty training and fitting is simply a sizing chart.  The sizing chart shows the customer where to measure the ankle or calf so that the customer can choose the appropriate size on the chart. \r\r\tAccordingly, we find that the graduated compression socks and graduated compression calf sleeves in this case are not surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment classified in subheading 6115.10.05, HTSUS.  The graduated compression socks and calf sleeves are not prescribed by a physician, are not specially fitted by medical personnel, and are not advertised or sold for the treatment of venous diseases or other serious medical conditions.  Instead, we find that the socks and calf sleeves are graduated compression hosiery designed for general use or active use and are properly classified in subheading 6115.10.40, HTSUS, and subheading 6307.90.98, HTSUS, respectively. \r\rHOLDING: \r\r      \tBy application of GRIs 1 and 6, Medi’s graduated compression socks are classified under heading 6115, HTSUS, specifically subheading 6115.10.4000, HTSUSA, which provides for “Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins) and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Graduated compression hosiery (for example, stockings for varicose veins): Surgical panty hose and surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.”  The 2018 and 2019 column one, general rate of duty is 14.6% ad valorem.\r\r\tThe graduated compression calf sleeves are classified under heading 6307, HTSUS, specifically subheading 6307.90.9889, HTSUSA, which provides for “Other made up articles, including dress patterns: Other: Other: Other: Other: Other.”  The 2018 and 2019 column one, general rate of duty is 7% ad valorem. \r\r      \tYou are instructed to DENY the protest.\r      \r     \t In accordance with Sections IV and VI of the CBP Protest/Petition Processing Handbook (HB 3500-08A, December 2007, pp. 24 and 26), you are to mail this decision, together with the CBP Form 19, to the Protestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter.

NY N105688 pertains to the tariff classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) of footwear referred to as “Style # KATAPULT2009.”  The request has been made on behalf of importer Athletic Training Innovations, LLC (“ATI”).  Our response follows.  \r\rFACTS:\r\r\t In NY N105688, a sample pair of the subject footwear, copies of suggested training programs, a DVD, and a textile strap were submitted with the ruling request.  Style # KATAPULT2009 is a training shoe that fits over the ankle, with an upper and outer sole of rubber and plastics, used by men and women.  The outer sole of the footwear is molded over the upper and forms a foxing-like band.  Unlike traditional athletic shoes, this footwear does not have a cushioned heel portion of an outer sole that is in contact with the ground. Instead, the footwear has a large, elevated, platform-type outer sole permanently affixed under the front part of the footwear that extends past the outline of the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  It is designed to provide stability while engaging in activities, while also keeping the wearer’s heel from touching the ground.  The footwear is imported with a product information DVD, copies of suggested training programs and the textile strap.  The strap measures approximately 1½ inch wide and 6 feet long.  The DVD shows a woman wrapping the strap around her shoes and performing stretching exercises, and a man and woman demonstrating various exercises while wearing the shoes.  In NY N105688, CBP determined that the essential character of the set was provided by the footwear and classified the merchandise in subheading 6402.91.90, HTSUS, which provides for “Other footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics: Other footwear: Other footwear covering the ankle: Other: Other: Other: Valued over $12/pair,” dutiable at 20% ad valorem.\r\rATI asserts that the correct classification of the footwear is under subheading 9506.91.00, HTSUS, as “Articles and equipment for general physical exercise, gymnastics or athletics; parts and accessories thereof,” dutiable at 4.6% ad valorem.  ATI alternatively asserts that the proper subheading is 6402.19.90, HTSUS, which provides for “Other footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics: Sports footwear: Other: Other: Valued over $12/pair,” dutiable at 9% ad valorem.\r\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhether the subject footwear is classifiable under (1) subheading 6402.19.90, HTSUS, as sports footwear; (2) subheading 6402.91.90, HTSUS, as other footwear covering the ankle; or (3) subheading 9506.91.00, HTSUS, as articles and equipment for general physical exercise, gymnastics or athletics?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification under the HTSUS is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  “GRI 1 is paramount … The HTSUS is designed so that most classification decisions can be answered by GRI 1 …”  Telebrands Corp. v. United States, 865 F. Supp. 2d 1277, 1280 (C.I.T. 2012).  Merchandise that is described “in whole by a single classification heading or subheading” is classifiable under that heading.  CamelBak Products LLC. v. United States, 649 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2011).  At that point, the succeeding GRIs are rendered inoperative.  Mita Copystar America v. United States, 160 F.3d 710, 712 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 may then be applied in order.  \r\rIn addition, in interpreting the HTSUS, the Explanatory Notes (ENs) of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System may be utilized.\u00A0 The ENs, although not dispositive or legally binding, provide a commentary on the scope of each heading, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the HTSUS.  See T.D. 89\u001E80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127 (August 23, 1989).  \r\r\tThe HTSUS provisions under consideration in this case are as follows:\r\r6402\t\t\tOther footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics:\r\t\t\t\t\tSports footwear:\r\t\t\t\t\t*\t*\t*\r6402.19\t\t\t\tOther:\r\t\t\t\t\t\t*\t*\t*\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther:\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*\t*\t*\r6402.19.90\t\t\t\t\tValued over $12/pair.\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*\t*\t*\r\t\t\t\t\tOther footwear:\r6402.91\t\t\t\tCovering the ankle:\t\t\t\t\t\r\t\t\t\t\t\t*\t*\t*\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther:\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*\t*\t*\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther:\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*\t*\t*\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther:\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*\t*\t*\r6402.91.90\t\t\t\t\t\t\tValued over $12/pair.\t\t\t\t\r*\t*\t*\t*\r9506\t\t\tArticles and equipment for general physical exercise, gymnastics, athletics, other sports (including table-tennis) or outdoor games, not specified or included elsewhere in this chapter; swimming pools and wading pools; parts and accessories thereof:\r\t\t\t\t*\t*\t*\r\t\t\t\t\tOther:\r9506.91.00\t\t\tArticles and equipment for general physical exercise, gymnastics or athletics; parts and accessories thereof.\r*\t*\t*\t*\r\rThe subheadings under consideration are eo nomine provisions that describe articles by specific names and not by use.  Absent limiting language or contrary legislative intent, an eo nomine provision covers all forms of the named article.  Nidec Corporation v. United States, 68 F.3d 1333, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  \r\rThe group of imported items consists of the footwear, copies of suggested training programs, a DVD and a textile strap.  The textile strap is possibly described by heading 6307, HTSUS.  The DVD is possibly described by heading 8523, HTSUS.  The \rcopies of suggested training programs are described by heading 4911, HTSUS.  The footwear is possibly described by headings 6402 or 9506, HTSUS.  \r\rBecause no single heading of the HTSUS completely describes the imported items and, as noted above, its components are prima facie classifiable in two or more headings, classification must fall to GRI 3.  GRI 3 provides, in pertinent part:\r\rWhen by application of Rule 2 (b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows:\r… \r\r(b)\tMixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.\r\rThe Explanatory Notes to GRI 3(b) state the following\r\r(X)\tFor the purposes of this Rule, the term “goods put up in sets for retail sale” shall be taken to mean goods which:\r\r(a) consist of at least two different articles which are, prima facie, classifiable in different headings.  Therefore, for example, six fondue forks cannot be regarded as a set within the meaning of this Rule;\r\r(b)\tconsist of products or articles put up together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity; and \r\t\t\r(c)\tare put up in a manner suitable for sale directly to users without repacking (e.g., in boxes or cases or on boards) …\r\rThe group of items as imported meet the above requirements, and is a “set” for purposes of GRI 3(b).  In its discussion of the essential character of composite goods, EN (VIII) to GRI 3(b) states:\r\rThe factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods. It may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of a constituent material in relation to the use of the goods.\r\rThere have been several court decisions on \""essential character\"" for purposes of classification under GRI 3(b).  See Conair Corp. v. United States, 29 C.I.T. 888 (2005); Structural Industries v. United States, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1330, 1337-1338 (C.I.T. 2005); and Home Depot USA, Inc. v. United States, 427 F. Supp. 2d 1278, 1295-1356 (C.I.T. 2006), aff’d by 491 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (\""[E]ssential character is that which is indispensable to the structure, core or condition of the article, i.e., what it is.\"") (quoting A.N. Deringer, Inc. v. United States, 66 Cust. Ct. 378, 383 (1971)).  In particular, the court stated \""[a]n essential character inquiry requires a fact intensive analysis.\""  Id. at 1284.  \r\rHere, the copies of suggested training programs act as guides to maximizing the activities performed while wearing the footwear.  The strap appears to be designed to be used in a limited fashion as an accessory to the footwear during stretching exercises, while the bulk of activity performed in the footwear consists of various field training exercises conducted without employing the strap.  The DVD contains videos showing a woman performing said stretches and a man and woman performing the field exercises.  Both the stretches and the field exercises are performed in the footwear.  There would be little value in possessing the DVD, strap or copies of suggested training programs without also possessing the item needed to perform both of those activities.  Taking the above into account, we find that the essential character of the set is provided by the footwear because it is indispensable for the performance of all of the depicted activities.  Therefore, classification of the set will be determined by the classification of the footwear, per GRI 3(b).\r\rYou assert that the footwear should be excluded from consideration as “footwear” and instead be classified under Chapter 95, HTSUS, as sports equipment.  In support of this, you note that the article is designed to perform specific exercises that target calf muscle training and is not intended to be worn as “regular sports and athletic footwear” as evident by its design and support structure.  You also state that the article cannot be worn for an extended period of time as is typical of footwear (specifically athletic footwear) and the essential character and purpose of the article is provided by the parts that do not cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, i.e., the platform that elevates the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and allows the wearer to exercise the leg muscles.  In the alternative, you assert that the footwear is classifiable as “sports footwear” under subheading 6402.19.90, HTSUS.\r\rWe first note that Note 1(g) to Chapter 95, HTSUS, excludes sports footwear from Chapter 95, HTSUS.  Thus, if the subject footwear is classifiable in subheading 6402.19.90, HTSUS, consideration of the applicability of Chapter 95, HTSUS, ends.\r\rHeading 6402, HTSUS, covers “Other footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics …” There is no dispute that the footwear possesses outer soles and uppers of rubber and plastics.  If the footwear indeed classifiable in heading 6402, the question then becomes whether it is “sports footwear” classified in subheading 6402.19.90, HTSUS, or “Other footwear: Covering the ankle:  Other: Other: Other: Valued over $12/pair” and classified in subheading 6402.91.90, HTSUS. \r\rIn order to qualify as “sports footwear,” Subheading Note 1 to Chapter 64 states the following:\r\rFor the purpose of subheadings 6402.12, 6402.19, 6403.12, 6403.19 and 6404.11, the expression “sports footwear” applies only to:\r\rFootwear which is designed for a sporting activity and has, or has provision for the attachment of spikes, sprigs, cleats, stops, lips, bars or the like;\rSkating boots, ski-boots and cross-country ski footwear, snowboard boots, wrestling boots, boxing boots and cycling shoes.\r\rClearly the subject article is not a skating boot, ski-boot or any other type of footwear described in subparagraph (b) above.  As stated above, in support for the argument that the article is classifiable under heading 95, HTSUS, you state that the article is designed to perform specific exercises that target calf muscle training and is not intended to be worn as “regular sports and athletic footwear” as evident by its design and support structure.  You also state that the article cannot be worn for an extended period of time as is typical of footwear (specifically athletic footwear) and the essential character and purpose of the article is provided by the parts that do not cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, i.e., the platform that elevates the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and allows the wearer to exercise the leg muscles.  We agree that the article is not intended to be worn as “regular sports and athletic footwear.”  We also emphasize that we have long interpreted Subheading Note 1 to Chapter 64, HTSUS, is a narrow manner.  For instance, in NY H87213, dated February 2, 2002, a pair of American football shoes and two pairs of soccer shoes were held to not be classifiable as “sports footwear” because the projections from their soles did not constitute “cleats” under subheading Note 1 to Chapter 64.  In the ruling we noted:\rIt has long been Customs position that subheading note 1 should be interpreted narrowly. We note that the phrase which states that ‘sports footwear’ applies only to ...’ conveys an intent to reasonably limit footwear classified as ‘sports footwear.’\r     \rCustoms interpretation of the terms spikes, sprigs, cleats, stops, bars or the like in regards to ‘sports footwear’ has generally been to include projections attached to, or molded into, the soles of sports footwear” to provide traction during outdoor sporting activities such as golf, field sports, (baseball, soccer, American football, rugby etc.) or track & field events. In addition, crampons and similar attachments for rock/ice-climbing boots have also been included as fitting the definition of these terms … It is further our interpretation that all the exemplars listed in the note have relatively sharp points or edges which are designed to dig into the ground (turf or ice). In order to effectively dig into turf or ice, such projections, generally, must be spaced fairly widely apart. \r\rHere, the footwear possesses no projections whatsoever and is therefore precluded from classification as “sports footwear” in subheading 6402.19, HTSUS.\r\rSubheading 6402.19.90, HTSUS, eo nomine provides for “Other footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics: Other footwear: Covering the ankle:  Other: Other: Other: Valued over $12/pair.”  The subject article, which is not “sports footwear,” possesses characteristics that are directly described by the subheading.  As such, the article is classifiable in subheading 6402.19.90, HTSUS.\r\rOur analysis does not end here, however, because we must also examine the applicability of heading 9506, HTSUS.  Heading 9506 provides for “Articles and equipment for … sports …,” which is referred to as “sports equipment.”  The tariff does not define the term “sports equipment,” however the courts have had occasion to define it.  In Bauer Nike Hockey USA, Inc. v. United States, 393 F.3d 1246, 1260-51 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the Federal Circuit defined the term as articles that are “necessary, useful or appropriate” for that sport. The court further refined that definition in LeMans Corp. v. United States, 660 F.3d 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2011), in which it looked to the Explanatory Notes to heading 9506.  EN 95.06(B) states that Heading 9506 covers many requisites for sports, some of which are actually worn by their user, such as protective equipment in the form of fencing masks and breast plates, elbow and knee pads, cricket pads, shin-guards, ice hockey pants with built-in guards and pads.  The court noted the following:\r\r[T]he Explanatory Notes to Section 9506 indicate that, to the extent \""sports equipment\"" encompasses articles worn by a user, those articles are not apparel-like and are almost exclusively protective in nature. …\r\rAccordingly, we find that the CIT properly looked to the Explanatory Notes to Section 9506 to assist with the interpretation of Heading 9506. The vast majority of the examples in those notes are items that a user would not <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> on his or her  body, but instead consist of articles that are entirely separate from the user (e.g., tennis nets, children's playground equipment, archery targets, bob-sleds), held by the user in his or her hand (e.g., golf clubs, tennis rackets, polo mallets, hockey sticks), or are accessories fastened to a user (e.g., snow skis, water skis, ice skates). The few examples that a user actually would <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, which are identified [as fencing masks and breast plates, elbow and knee pads, cricket pads, shin-guards, ice hockey pants with built-in guards and pads,] are almost exclusively used for protection and would complement, or be worn in addition to, apparel worn for a particular sport.\r\rId. at 1319 – 1322.  Therefore, “sports equipment” is defined as merchandise that is not akin to apparel and is necessary, useful or appropriate for a sport, and if the merchandise is worn by a user, the merchandise is almost exclusively protective in nature and complements, or is worn in addition to, apparel worn for a particular sport.  Id.; see also Riddell, Inc. v. United States, 37 C.I.T. ___, Slip Op. 13-37 (March 20, 2013).  \r\r\tHere, the footwear is not “necessary, useful or appropriate for a sport.”  As stated by you, it cannot be worn for “an extended period of time as typical of footwear and specifically, athletic footwear.”  Additionally, the article offers no protection to its user in a manner akin to the exemplars of EN 95.06(B)(13).  It is instead specialized footwear designed  to emphasize the engagement of specific muscle groups during targeted training.

The final sample is a pair of flat rubber and/or plastic outer soles, which are specially designed for and are intended to be attached onto the bottoms of the two “formed (slipper) uppers” by means of a hook-and-loop mounting method. With these outer soles attached, the two slipper uppers would also be considered classifiable as finished footwear, complete with outer soles of rubber/plastics that will contact the ground.  These items, you state, will be sold to various hotel chains for use by the hotel’s guests.  If imported separately, the outer soles and the slipper uppers will be classified separately under their respective tariff subheadings.  However, if imported together in the same shipment, the outer soles with the slipper uppers would constitute complete slippers with textile uppers and rubber/plastic outer soles, entered assembled or disassembled, finished or not, but otherwise complete and would be so classified under a single footwear subheading.  We will presume, for the purpose of this ruling, that the soles and the formed slipper uppers will be entered separately and so, we will provide the tariff classification subheadings that will therefore be applicable.  \r\r\tThe six submitted samples are described as follows:\r\r(A) Item #55U-BLJ-007 - A closed-toe, open-back house slipper with what you state is a cotton terry cloth textile upper.  The slipper also has a soft ¾-inch thick foam plastic midsole and a textile outer sole that is covered with an evenly spaced pattern of small, 1/32-inch thick, rubber/plastic traction dots.  Previous rulings have already determined that these traction dots are not akin to the “spikes, bars, nails, protectors or similar attachments” enumerated in Chapter 64, note 4(b) and thus must be taken into consideration when determining the constituent material of the outer sole. The proper classification determination is therefore contingent on whether the rubber/plastic dots or the textile material on the outer sole has the greatest contact with the ground. The determinative factor, according to the most current decision issued by Customs Headquarters, is the size of the traction dots featured on the particular shoe and their placement on the outer sole.  Although you have not provided any actual surface area sole measurements for this sample, based on our visual examination of the sole, we will presume that more of the textile material contacts the ground.  Therefore, this slipper will be classified as having a predominately textile outer sole.\r\rB. Item #55U-BLJ-40E – A closed-toe, open-heel house slipper with a terry cloth fabric textile upper, a foam plastic padded textile footbed insole and a sewn-on rubber/plastic outer sole.\r\rC. Item #55U-BLJ-10B – An open-toe, open-heel house slipper with a terry cloth fabric textile upper, a foam plastic padded textile faced footbed and a sewn-on rubber/plastic outer sole.\r\rD. Item #55U-BLJ-002TB – A formed slipper upper with a sewn-on fully closed bottom that already has the finished shape of the completed slipper, but does not yet have an actual outer sole intended to come in contact with the ground when the slipper is worn.  The external surface area of the upper of this incomplete slipper is comprised of a fibrous non-woven fabric material, which you call paper but which we consider to be a textile material.   The bottom of this “formed upper”, which is like a <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> shaped insole, consists of a thin plastic sheeting material padded with foam plastic, encased on top and bottom by layers of textile material and finished with a stitched on textile edging.  The outer side of the insole bottom is faced with the type of fibrous textile material that allows for the attachment of an outer sole designed to stick to it by means of a hook-and-loop adhesion mounting.  Since you have not provided a value, we will presume this item to be valued not over $3 per pair.\r\rE. Item #55U-BLJ-002TA – A formed slipper upper with a sewn-on fully closed bottom that already has the finished shape of the completed slipper, but does not yet have an actual outer sole intended to contact the ground when the slipper is worn. The external surface area of this upper of this incomplete slipper is, you state, a cotton terry textile material.  The bottom of this “formed upper” is also like a <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> shaped insole, consisting of a thin plastic sheeting material layer padded with foam plastic, encased on top and bottom by layers of textile material and finished with a stitched on textile edging.  The outer side of the insole bottom is faced with the type of fibrous textile material that allows for the attachment of an outer sole designed to stick to it by means of a hook-and-loop adhesion mounting.  Since you have not provided a value, we will presume this item to be valued not over $3 per pair.\r\rF. Item #55U-BLJ-002B- A pair of rubber/plastic outer soles finished with a top surface layer of plastic hooks and loops, which allow these outer soles to adhere to the undersides of the fibrous textile fabric insole bottoms on a specially designed line of interchangeable styles of formed house slipper uppers.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the two house slippers (complete with outer soles) identified as Item #55U-BLJ-40E and Item #55U-BLJ-10B, will be 6404.19.3515, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear, in which the upper’s external surface is predominately textile materials; in which the outer sole’s external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not “athletic footwear”; which is not designed to be a protection against water, oil, or cold or inclement weather; which has open toes or open heels; and which is 10% or more by weight of rubber and/or plastics.  The rate of duty will be 37.5% ad valorem.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the unisex style slipper, identified as Item #55U-BLJ-007 (which you state has a cotton fiber upper) will be 6405.20.3060, HTS, which provides for footwear, in which the outer sole’s external surface is not predominately rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather; in which the upper’s external surface is predominately textile materials; in which the largest fabric of the upper consists, by weight, predominately of vegetable fibers such as cotton or flax (linings, accessories and reinforcements not included); and which has a line of demarcation between the sole and the upper.  The rate of duty will be 7.5% ad valorem.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the two slipper uppers (without outer soles) identified as Item #55U-BLJ-002TB and Item #55U-BLJ2TA, will be 6406.10.2500, HTS, which provides for parts of footwear which are “formed uppers,” in which the external surface of the upper (not including the insole, accessories or reinforcements) is predominately textile material, and which is valued, we presume, at or under $3.00 per pair.  The rate of duty will be 33.6% ad valorem.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the pair of rubber/plastic outer soles, identified by you as Item #55U-BLJ-002B and wrapped in a sealed cellophane bag marked “Made in China” will be 6406.20.0000, HTS, which provides for footwear outer soles or heels which would be in contact with the ground in use, and which are of rubber or plastics.  The rate of duty is 2.7% ad valorem.\r\r\tWe are returning the samples as you requested.\r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

"{""text"":""NY M82846\r\rMAY 15, 2006\r\rCLA-2-64:RR:NC:247: M82846\r\rCATEGORY:  Classification\r\rTARIFF NO.: 6405.20.90 \r\rMs. Yvonne Sherri Lopez\rRobert D. Gordon, LCB\rDBA Cali America Customs Broker\r161 W. Victoria Street, Suite 220\rLong Beach, CA 90805\r\rRE:\tThe tariff classification of footwear from Italy.\r\rDear Ms. Lopez:\r\r\tIn your letter dated April 5, 2006, you requested a tariff classification ruling for an item described as “CosySoles” microwave heated slipper.\r\t\r\tThe submitted sample is a textile slipper that covers the ankle, consisting of sewn together textile components, (i.e. upper panels and a separate textile panel on the walking surface).  The slipper has a hook & loop collar strap to secure it to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The slipper contains a natural sterilized grain that, when heated, retains heat for extended periods of time.  You state that the item was developed to provide aid to the discomfort caused by chronic cold feet.  \r\rGenerally, in order for an item to be classified as footwear in Chapter 64, it must have an outer sole that is a separate, identifiable component prior to its application to the upper.  In addition, the sole component must encompass the entire underfoot area and the complete article must not be designed for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> inside other footwear.  In this regard, “CosySoles” microwave heated slipper satisfies these requirements for footwear classified in Chapter 64 (HTSUS). \r\rRegarding your proposed secondary classification under HTS 9817.00.96, we do not agree that it applies.  You state that the item “was developed to provide a direct heat source as an aid for discomfort caused by chronic cold feet.”  \r\rUS Note 4-a to Subpart 17 of Chapter 98 of the HTS, requires that they be for persons “suffering from a permanent or chronic physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities, such as caring for one’s self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, or working.”  This does not apply to your item.  Your item does not have physical properties that make it readily distinguishable from articles useful to non-handicapped persons.  For example, we note that the current CosySoles web site indicates that one of the principle markets is for those whose feet have gotten cold due to their extended outdoor activities on snow or ice.  Also, while it would be of particular interest to those with very poor circulation to the feet caused by a chronic disease, the information you have supplied indicates that it is sells particularly well at the start of winter in cold climates.  This implies that it is not true that any use by the general public is so improbable that it would be fugitive, a major test for determining the applicability of HTS 9817.00.96.  See Headquarters Ruling Letter 556449, May 5,1992.  \r\rThe applicable subheading for “CosySoles” microwave heated slipper will be 6405.20.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for other footwear with uppers of textile material, other.  The rate of duty will be 12.5% ad valorem.\r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.  The text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on World Wide Web at http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/.\r\rThe submitted sample is not marked with the country of origin.  Therefore, if imported as is, it will not meet the country of origin marking requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1304.  Accordingly, the footwear would be considered not legally marked under the provisions of 19 C.F.R. 134.11 which states, \""every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit, in such manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the U.S. the English name of the country of origin of the article.\""\r\rThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

Customs received\radditional submissions from you on this matter and the\rinformation and arguments contained therein have been taken into\rconsideration in this response.  Sample garments were received\rfor Customs consideration.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     Your client, Regaliti, received a classification ruling from\rNew York Customs, NYRL 854333 of August 7, 1990, classifying\rmerchandise identified as styles 4892G and 4812G as tights of\rheading 6115, HTSUSA.  Subsequently, Regaliti received\rclassification rulings from Customs in Boston and Newark, BORL\r857484 of November 6, 1990, for styles 4813 and 4811, and NJRL\r857485 of November 19, 1990, for styles 4835 and 4999,\rrespectively.  These rulings classified garments which were\rextremely similar to styles 4892G and 4812G as trousers of\rheading 6104, HTSUSA.\r\r     The garments which were the subject of the rulings at issue\rare all made from 95 percent cotton/5 percent spandex knit\rfabric.  Each garment has an elastic waistband formed by a\rnearly one-inch elastic band covered by the fabric of the\rgarment, a diamond-shaped gusset in the crotch and hemmed leg\r                               -2-\r\r\rbottoms.  The garments conform to the contours of the wearer's\rbody and differ only in length.  It is claimed the garments were\rdesigned for use during exercise.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Are the garments at issue, styles 4892G, 4812G, 4813, 4811,\r4835, and 4999, which are known as \""leggings\"" properly\rclassifiable as tights of heading 6115, HTSUSA, or as trousers or\rshorts (depending on garment length) of heading 6104, HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, provided such\rheadings or notes do not otherwise require, according to [the\rremaining GRIs taken in order].\""\r\r     Customs takes note of the fact that the garments at issue\rare relatively new creations of the fashion industry, as is the\ruse of the term \""leggings\"" to describe them.  The term \""leggings\""\rby which they are known commercially was not in wide-spread use\rwhen the current tariff was adopted.  However, the tariff does\rcontain a provision which includes leggings, i.e., heading 6406,\rHTSUSA, which provides for, inter alia, gaiters, leggings and\rsimilar articles.  A gaiter is defined in The American Heritage\rDictionary, (2nd College Ed. 1982), as:\r\r     1. A leather or heavy cloth covering for the legs extending\r     from the instep to the ankle or knee. 2. An ankle-high shoe\r     with elastic sides. 3. An overshoe with a cloth top.\r\rFrom the same source, leggings are defined as:\r\r     A leg covering of material such as canvas or leather.\r\rFairchild's Dictionary of Fashion, (2nd Ed. 1988), defines\rlegging as:\r\r     Covering for leg and ankle extending to knee or sometimes\r     secured by stirrup strap under arch of <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Worn in 19th\r     c. by armed services and by civilian men.  See PUTTEE and\r     GAITER.  Worn by women in suede, patent, and fabric in late\r     1960s.\r\r     It seems clear from the above definitions that the leggings\rclassified in heading 6406, HTSUSA, are not the same merchandise\rthat is at issue here.\r\r                               -3-\r\r\r     In determining the proper classification of the garments at\rissue, two headings clearly merit consideration.  These are\rheading 6104, HTSUSA, which provides for, inter alia, trousers,\rbreeches and shorts, and heading 6115, HTSUSA, which provides\rfor, inter alia, tights.\r\r     It is a well-established tenet of customs law that tariff\rterms are construed in accordance with their common and\rcommercial meanings and that the common meaning of a tariff term\ris a question of law.  Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. United\rStates, 7 CIT 178, 182, 585 F. Supp. 649 (1984), aff'd, 753 F.2d\r1061 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  You assert that the garments at issue\rhere are classified under heading 6115, HTSUSA, as tights based\ron the classification principle of eo nomine designation and the\rcommon meaning of the term tights.\r\r     The HTSUSA and the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized\rSystem are silent on the meaning of the term tights.  However,\rtrousers are defined in the Explanatory Notes as:\r\r     garments which envelop each leg separately, covering the\r     knees and usually reaching down to or below the ankles;\r     these garments usually stop at the waist; the presence of\r     braces does not cause these garments to lose the essential\r     character of trousers.\r\r     As the tariff is silent regarding the meaning of tights, it\ris reasonable and proper to look to lexicographic sources.  In\rsupport of your contention you provided the following dictionary\rdefinitions for tights:\r\r     A close-fitting, stretchable garment covering the body from\r     the waist or the neck down and worn especially by dancers\r     and gymnasts.  Tormont Webster's Illustrative Encyclopedic\r     Dictionary (1990 Ed.)\r\r     Skin tight garments covering the body from the neck down or\r     from the waist down and worn especially for ease and display\r     by dancers, acrobats or gymnasts.  Webster's Third New\r     International Dictionary, Unabridged (1961 Ed.)\r\r     Skin tight garments, usually for the lower part of the body\r     and the legs worn especially by performers in public.\r     Webster's New International Dictionary, Unabridged (2nd Ed.)\r\r     Skin-fitting garments, commonly for the legs and lower\r     torso.

As pointed out in your brief, the statutory canon\rof construction \""noscitur a sociis\"" is useful in determining the\rcommon and commercial meaning of the term tights.  With that in\rmind, Customs has researched various lexicographic sources to\rdiscern the common meaning of trousers and of tights, hose and\rhosiery.  The following pertinent definitions were found.\r\r     TROUSERS\r\r          An outer garment of men or boys, extending from the\r          waist to the knee or, oftener and almost always with\r          men, to the ankle, and covering each leg separately.\r          Orig. they were of the nature of long hose or tight\r          drawers and were worn esp. by sailors and soldiers.\r          Webster's New International Dictionary, Unabridged\r          (2nd Ed., 1939)\r\r          A usually loose-fitting outer garment for the lower\r          part of the body, having individual leg portions that\r          reach typically to the ankle but sometimes to any of\r          various other points from the upper leg down, worn esp.\r          by men and boys.

We do not believe the garments at issue herein,\rRegaliti's leggings, are a form of hosiery.  In Mast Industries\rv. United States, 9 CIT 549, 552 (1985), aff'd, 786 F. 2d 1144\r(1986), the court noted, citing United States v. Bruce Duncan\rCo., 50 CCPA 43, 46, C.A.D. 817 (1963), \""the merchandise itself\rmay be strong evidence of use.\""  The garments at issue are form-\rfitting and cover the lower torso and legs, however, upon\rexamination Customs believes they are more in the nature of\rtrousers, than hosiery.  The above-cited definitions of trousers\rindicate that they are garments which cover the lower torso from\rthe waist to the ankle or, sometimes, simply to the knee, and\rcover each leg separately.  At least one definition above\rillustrates that trousers may be close-fitting depending on the\rfashion.  Additionally, Customs notes that although the cited\rdefinitions refer to trousers as garments worn especially by men\ror boys, women too <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> trousers.  Therefore, it would appear\rthat the garments at issue are within the definition of trousers,\rincluding the definition contained in the Explanatory Notes of\rthe Harmonized System.\r\r     The meaning of the term tights was examined by the Customs\rCourt in Children's Hose Inc., v. United States, 55 Cust. Ct. 6,\rC.D. 2547 (1965).  In that case, the court stated:\r\r     [T]he court may take judicial notice of the fact that\r     leotards or tights whether worn by children or women are\r     designed to be at least partially utilized under an\r     outergarment and partially exposed, depending upon the age\r     of the wearer and the purpose for which they are worn.  It\r     would, therefore, seem that if a portion of this imported\r     merchandise is underwear, a portion of it is not underwear.\r     By the same token, while the exposed portion may be\r     outerwear, the portion concealed would not be outerwear.\r                               -7-\r\r\r     Therefore, the articles at bar are more than underwear and\r     more than outerwear.  They are, therefore, in fact \""neither\r     fish nor fowl.\""  (at 9 and 10)\r\rIt is clear from the language of the court, that tights are\rgarments which are partially underwear and partially outerwear.\rThe extent to which the garment is exposed to view is dependent\rupon the age of the wearer and the purpose for which the garment\ris worn.  This interpretation would follow some of the previously\rcited definitions for tights which describe them as knitted pants\rand stockings in one piece or underpants and stockings knit in\rone piece.\r\r     In United States v. Great Pacific Co., Shui Tai & Co., 23\rCCPA 319, 324, T.D. 48192, the court stated:\r\r     A common meaning, having been once established and\r     determined by a court, will be presumed to continue until\r     the language is changed by subsequent legislation.\r\rHowever, the tariff schedules in force at the time of Children's\rHose did not have a provision for tights as the current tariff\rdoes, nor did it have a provision for trousers.  Therefore, while\rthe determination of the court regarding the meaning of the term\rtights and the manner in which they are designed to be worn is\rinstructive in this case, it is not determinative because the\rterm tights was not part of the statutory language of the tariff\rat the time of Children's Hose.  The meaning of an eo nomine\rclassification is determined as of the time of the enactment of\rthe tariff provision.  FAG Bearings, Ltd. v. United States, 9 CIT\r227, 228 (1985)  In this case, the HTSUSA (of which heading 6115\rwhich provides for tights is part) was enacted as part of the\rOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, P.L. 100-418,\rTitle I, sec. 1201, 102 Stat. 1147 (1988), and became effective\ron January 1, 1989.  Nonetheless, Customs does not believe the\rcommon meaning of the term tights changed much between 1965 and\r1989.\r\r     You have argued that the merchandise is essentially within\rthe common meaning of tights because it is body-conforming,\rcovers the lower torso, and is designed for use during exercise.\rWhile the definitions of tights indicate their use by athletes\rand performers, they also indicate that tights are garments for\rgeneral <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> by women and girls.  The court in Children's Hose,\rat 8, recognized that tights are worn for warmth and fashion.\r\r     In deciding if the subject garments are within the eo nomine\rclassification for tights, Customs may consider the use of the\rmerchandise.  United States v. Quon Quon Co., 46 CCPA 70, 73,\r                               -8-\r\r\rC.A.D. 699 (1959).  Customs interprets the use of the\rmerchandise to include the manner in which it is worn as well as\rthe reasons for which it is worn.\r\r     Included as part of your submission is a letter from the\rVice-President in charge of design for Regaliti Inc., Mr. Robert\rFink.  In his letter, Mr. Fink states that the styles at issue\rherein, along with a number of other Regaliti styles, were\rdesigned for use during exercise and for that reason should be\rconsidered tights.  Customs rejects the criteria of athletic use\rto identify a garment as tights because, as noted above, tights\rare worn for reasons beyond athletic use.  Sweat pants are\rdesigned for use during exercise, but that does not make them any\rless pants.  Therefore, Customs will look to the manner in which\rthey are worn.\r\r     You have submitted that if worn outside the athletic area,\rthe garments at issue are principally worn with another garment\rwhich conceals the lower torso.  Customs recognizes that the\rgarments at issue herein belong to a class of garments known\rcommercially as leggings which are usually worn with another\rgarment, such as an oversized shirt or sweater, which covers the\rlower torso.  However, these garments are generally worn in\rconjunction with a garment which just barely covers the lower\rtorso, i.e., reaches just below the hip area.  Consequently, the\rportion of the leggings which covers the lower torso is exposed\rto view as the wearer reaches or bends or moves about in the\rcourse of normal activity.  Additionally, these garments are not\ralways worn with a garment which covers the lower torso.  They\rmay be worn without such a garment according to the discretion\rof the wearer.  Customs believes the donning of another garment\rto cover the lower torso when wearing leggings such as the\rgarments at issue is a function of fashion and the personal\rperception of the individual regarding her own body image and how\rbest to flatter it.  It is not a matter of necessity as it would\rbe in the case of tights.  As the court noted in Children's Hose,\rtights consist of a portion which is not intended to be exposed,\rwhich is partially underwear.  Customs believes the same cannot\rbe said of the subject garments.  They are not partially\runderwear.  They may be worn as street <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> without a garment to\rcover the lower torso if the wearer so chooses.  Tights, on the\rother hand, if worn as street <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, must be worn with another\rgarment covering the lower torso.\r\r     You have submitted some of your client's advertising\rmaterial and copies of purchase orders which identify these\rgarments as tights.  While Customs will always consider such\rmaterial, it must also recognize that such material may be self-\rserving.  We have examined advertising material for leggings\rsimilar in appearance to your client's garments.  It is\r                               -9-\r\r\rinteresting to find that in the Fall & Winter 1990 J.C. Penney\rCatalog, garments which are similar in appearance to those at\rissue are identified in the catalog as pants.  They are\ridentified as ankle-length pants, capri pants or simply pants.\rIn one instance, a garment is identified as leggings in the\rdescriptive material, yet identified as pants in a photograph of\rthe garment.  Leggings of the type at issue herein are often\radvertised either before, after, or alongside advertisements for\rtights.  But, they are not advertised as tights or to be worn\rnecessarily in the same manner as tights.  Additionally, these\rgarments are not displayed in the manner of tights, folded and\rpackaged, but in the manner of trousers, individually hung on\rhangers.  These garments are separately identified by the fashion\rindustry and the retail industry and this is evident by available\radvertising material and the manner in which the garments are\rdisplayed in stores.\r\r     Customs contacted store buyers regarding leggings and\rtights.  Two of these buyers were cooperative in answering\rquestions regarding leggings and tights.  Of course, the\rinformation provided was based on their personal opinions,\rhowever, we believe it to be informative considering their\rpositions.  Based on those conversations, Customs learned of the\rdifference in the display of leggings from tights.  Each buyer\rviewed tights and leggings as different articles.  One buyer\rstated that leggings are sold in every department of the store;\rthey are not limited to simply one area.  This same buyer\rindicated that tights and leggings are worn differently.\rLeggings may be worn with an oversized sweater, but tights would\rnot be so worn.  The other buyer indicated she would not view\rleggings as pants or tights and that leggings are usually of a\rheavier fabric than tights.  Customs views this information as\rsupportive that tights and leggings, at least the ones at issue\rherein, are distinct articles and thus, differently classified.\r\r     Finally, you have claimed that based on the design,\rconstruction and intended function of your client's leggings,\rthey should be classified as tights.  Customs agrees with the\rcourt's statement in Hampco Apparel, Inc. v. United States, 12\rCIT 92, 96 (1988), that \""a fugitive use or uses does not take [a\rgarment] out of the classification of its original and primary\ruse.\""  We simply disagree in this instance regarding the primary\ruse of the garments at issue.  While they may indeed be utilized\rby some for exercise or athletic activity, Customs is of the view\rthat the garments will primarily be worn as street <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and any\rathletic use will be a fugitive use.\r\r     Having examined various classification arguments which have\rbeen presented regarding this merchandise, we return to the\rgarments themselves, for it is the garments on which the\rclassification decision is based.  As stated earlier, Customs\r                              -10-\r\r\rdoes not regard these garments as hosiery.  On the contrary,\rthese garments fall within an emerging class of merchandise known\rcommercially as leggings and worn, in Customs view, principally\ras trousers by women and girls.  Customs decision that the\rgarments at issue herein are not a form of hosiery, but are\rtrousers, is based upon, not only the manner in which the\rgarments are worn, but also the overall appearance of the\rgarments and the cotton/spandex knit fabric from which the\rgarments are made.  Customs believes the fabric utilized in\rmanufacturing these garments is not fabric of the kind typically\rused in the manufacture of hosiery articles.  Instead, it is not\runlike cotton/spandex blend knit fabrics commonly used today to\rmake form-fitting dresses, skirts and tops.\r\r     Having determined that the garments at issue herein are of a\rclass of garments worn as trousers and commercially known as\rleggings, it is necessary to express caution in interpreting\rthis ruling.  The term leggings is being used liberally by the\rfashion industry to identify a range of garments which have in\rcommon the characteristic of being form-fitting.  As with any\rrange, there are extremes.  Customs is of the view that that is\rtrue of leggings.  There are garments currently identified as\rleggings which may be classifiable as tights depending on the\rnature of the garments and whether they fall within the meaning\rof tights as expressed by the court in Children's Hose.\r\r     The garments at issue herein are not of the fringe.  They\rare within what Customs perceives to be in the main stream.  They\rare among the majority of garments identified as leggings.  These\rgarments are worn in the manner of trousers, not tights.  In\raddition, they are constructed of fabric not normally associated\rwith hosiery articles such as tights, but of fabric in common use\rin today's ready-to-<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> garments.  Therefore, the subject\rgarments, styles 4892G, 4812G, 4813, 4811, 4835, and 4999, are\rclassifiable as women's trousers or shorts of heading 6104,\rHTSUSA.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     NYRL 854333 of August 7, 1990, issued to your client,\rRegaliti, Inc., was in error.  Pursuant to 19 CFR 177.9(d)(1),\rthat ruling is hereby revoked.  The garments classified therein,\rstyles 4892G and 4812G, are classifiable as women's trousers of\rheading 6104.62.2010, HTSUSA.  Garments classified in this\rheading are subject to duty at a rate of 16.7 percent ad valorem\rand fall within textile category 348.\r\r     In your February 19, 1991, supplemental submission, you\rpresented Customs with a copy of a ruling issued to your\rclient's manufacturer from the Hong Kong Trade Department.  The\rruling classified several samples of leggings in category 359,\r                              -11-\r\r\rincluding the two styles classified by Customs in NJRL 857485 as\rtrousers.  The ruling points out that the classification advice\rgiven therein is not binding on the importing country which may\rapply different classification criteria.  While this ruling is of\rinterest to Customs in that it serves to illustrate the existence\rof discord and confusion on the classification of these garments,\ras pointed out by the Hong Kong Trade Department in their ruling,\rit is not binding on the U.S. Customs Service.\r\r     The Hong Kong Trade Department ruling classified the\rgarments by category.  Customs does not classify by category.\rCategory designation is the responsibility of the Committee for\rthe Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA).  On September\r10, 1991, in an effort to clarify the scope of categories\r359/659 with regard to tights contained therein, CITA issued a\rdirective to the Commissioner of Customs to amend the definition\rof tights contained in the Guidelines for the Reporting of\rImported Products in Various Textile and Apparel Categories, CIE\r13/88.  This directive appeared in the September 16, 1991, issue\rof the Federal Register.  Pursuant to the directive from CITA,\rCustoms will apply the new guideline regarding tights to\rdetermine the proper textile category for goods exported to the\rUnited States on or after January 1, 1992.\r\r     Due to the apparent confusion regarding the classification\rof your client's garments as evidenced by the conflicting rulings\rwhich were issued, Customs will delay the effective date of this\rruling until January 1, 1992, with respect to the revocation of\rNYRL 854333 of August 7, 1990.  This action is taken pursuant 19\rCFR 177.9(3)(1).  In addition, with the agreement of the\rCommerce Department and in accordance with the September 10,\r1991, directive from CITA, Customs will accept category 359\rvisas for shipments of styles 4892G and 4812G for which your\rclient has already contracted and which are shipped to the United\rStates prior to January 1, 1992.\r\r     As to your request for detrimental reliance in regard to\rrulings BORL 857484 and NJRL 857485 issued to your client in\rNovember 1990, Customs will issue its response in a separate\rletter.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, the visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since\rpart categories are the result of international bilateral\ragreements which are subject to frequent renegotiations and\rchanges, to obtain the most current information available, we\rsuggest you check, close to the time of shipment, the Status\rReport On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an internal\rissuance of the U.S. Customs Service which is updated weekly and\ris available for inspection at your local Customs office.\r                              -12-\r\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories, you should contact your local\rCustoms office prior to importation of this merchandise to\rdetermine the current status of any import restraints or\rrequirements.\r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director\r                                   Commercial Rulings Division\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1991/088454.doc"",""id"":4527,""rulingNumber"":""088454"",""subject"":""Revocation of Inconsistent Classification Rulings on    \""Leggings\""; Tights vs. Trousers; 6115, HTSUSA, vs. 6104,    HTSUSA"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1991-10-11T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""854333""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6104.62.2010""]}"

La Cienega Boulevard\r Inglewood, California  90304\r\r RE:  Snowboard ski boot; footwear; sports footwear; ski boot;\r      upper of textile material; upper less than 50 percent\r      leather; Upper of leather; outer sole of plastics.\r\r Dear Ms. Waddell:\r\r      This will acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July\r 31, 1990, regarding the tariff classification of boots for\r snowboard skiing.  Your letter and a sample of the goods have\r been forwarded to this office for a ruling.  After\r consideration of the information and samples provided, we have\r determined that the boots should be classified as set forth\r below.\r\r FACTS:\r\r      You requested a classification ruling for two styles of\r boots, both for use with a snowboard ski.  They are referred to\r as the \""Alpine\"" and \""Flight\"" models.  Both styles consist of\r two parts: a removable inner liner and an outer shell.\r Although your letter did not state that such was the case, we\r assume for the purposes of this ruling that the liner and outer\r shell will be imported as a retail unit.  We consider the liner\r to be part of a set with the shell, which will provide\r classification for the merchandise as a whole.\r\r      The \""Alpine\"" shell consists of two primary materials:\r textile and plastics.  The <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> portion is made entirely of\r molded plastic, as is the outer sole.  The upper portion of the\r shell is made of a thick plastic layer to which a white woven\r fabric lining and a black woven fabric outer layer are\r laminated.  The tongue of the shell is plastic, as are the trim\r and decorative overlay pieces.\r\r      The \""Flight\"" shell is similar in most respects except that\r the uppers are made of leather, rather than a textile/plastics\r combination.  The outer sole, trim and tongue pieces appear\r identical.  The liner also appears to be identical in both\r styles of boot.\r\r\r ISSUE:\r\r      How are these goods classified under the Harmonized Tariff\r Schedule of the United States Annotated?\r\r\r LAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r      Classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the\r United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is made in accordance with the\r General Rules of Interpretation (GRI's).  The systematic detail\r of the harmonized system is such that virtually all goods are\r classified by application of GRI 1, that is, according to the\r terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relevant\r Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot\r be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings\r and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs\r may be applied, taken in order.\r\r      The headings of Chapter 64 provide for the classification\r of footwear.  The provisions of each heading are distinguished\r by the component material which comprises the outer sole and/or\r the upper.  The outer soles of both styles are, as stated, of\r plastics.  The uppers of the Flight model are clearly of\r leather.  Classification of the Alpine model depends on whether\r or not the plastics and textile uppers of these boots are\r considered textile materials.  We believe that they are.  Our\r decision is based on the information you provided, and an\r examination which indicates that the surface of the uppers is\r primarily textile material according to Legal Note 4(a) to\r Chapter 64 (no account being taken of ornamentation, etc.).\r This finding is subject to verification by the port of entry.\r Below, we address first the classification of the Alpine model\r before turning to the Flight style.\r\r Alpine model\r\r      In reviewing the headings eligible for classification, we\r note the terms of heading 6404, HTSUSA:\r\r      6404      Footwear with outer soles of rubber. plastics.\r                leather or composition leather and uppers of\r                textile materials:\r\r                     Footwear with outer soles of rubber or\r                     plastics:\r\r These would appear to include the Alpine boots.  Within this\r heading, subheading 6404.11, HTSUSA, provides for:\r\r      6404.11             Sports footwear; tennis shoes,\r                          basketball shoes, gym shoes, training\r                          shoes and the like:\r\r The term \""sports footwear\"" is defined in Subheading Legal Note\r 1 to Chapter 64, HTSUSA, as:\r\r      1.   For the purposes of subheading 6402.11, 6402.19,\r           6403.19, and 6404.11, the expression \""sports\r           footwear\"" applies only to:\r\r           (a)  Footwear which is designed for a sporting\r                activity and has, or has provision for the\r                attachment of spikes, sprigs, cleats, stops,\r                clips bars or the like;\r\r           (b)  Skating boots, ski-boots, and cross-country ski\r                footwear, wrestling boots, boxing boots and\r                cycling shoes.\r\r\r (Emphasis added). Further, Additional U.S. Legal Note 2\r provides that:\r\r      2.   For the purposes of this chapter, the term \""tennis\r           shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes\r           and the like\"" covers athletic footwear other than\r           sports footwear (as defined in note 1 above), whether\r           or not principally used for such athletic games or\r           purposes.\r\r (Emphasis added).  The provisions of the subheading read in\r conjunction with the Legal Notes, as prescribed by GRI 1,\r clearly indicate that the instant merchandise is encompassed by\r the subheading terms regardless of whether we consider them\r \""ski-boots\""  \""sports footwear\"" or \""athletic footwear other than\r sports footwear.\""  That intent is obvious from a reading of the\r tariff provisions.  The instant merchandise is a type of\r footwear, and snowboarding (or snowboard skiing) is as much a\r sport (or athletic activity) as the other activities specified\r in the subheading and legal notes.  Further, the notes make\r clear that, at least for \""athletic footwear\"", the item need not\r be used principally for such athletic purposes.  It is\r sufficient, as in this case, that the boots possess attributes\r which indicate their suitability for a sport or athletic\r activity:  a stiff sole, textile laminated plastic uppers, and\r an insulated liner.  Some features indicate a design for\r sporting activity, and serve to distinguish the sample boots\r from ordinary insulated winter boots.  Other features are more\r common.\r\r      Footwear with less than 50 percent exterior surface of\r leather is classified in the \""other\"" provisions of 6404.11,\r HTSUSA.  This subheading is further divided based on the value\r per pair.  The instant goods described as the \""Alpine\"" style\r have less than 50 percent exterior surface of leather, and are\r valued at over $12.00 per pair, as provided for in subheading\r 6404.11.90, HTSUSA.\r\r Flight model\r\r      In reviewing the headings eligible for classification of\r the second sample, we note the terms of heading 6403, HTSUSA:\r\r      6403      Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\r                leather or composition leather and uppers of\r                leather:\r\r      The uppers on the \""Flight\"" model are clearly leather and\r the outer soles are plastic.  The above heading would appear to\r provide for the this item.  Subheading 6403.11, HTSUSA, further\r provides for:\r\r                     Sports footwear:\r      6403.11             Ski-boots and cross-country ski\r                          footwear:\r\r      6403.19             Other:\r\r Classification in these subheadings requires specific\r determinations: are the boots \""sports\"" footwear as described by\r the legal notes?  If so, are they considered \""ski-boots\""?  If\r not, the boots will be classified elsewhere in heading 6403,\r HTSUSA.\r\r\r      We find that the boots in this case are considered\r \""sports\"" footwear for classification purposes, but are not\r \""ski-boots\"" as contemplated by the nomenclature.\r\r      The nomenclature and legal notes contemplate a distinction\r between sports and athletic footwear (\""other than sports\r footwear\"").  In the case of the Alpine boots, that distinction\r did not impact on classification under the terms of heading\r 6404, HTSUSA.  For the Flight boots, under heading 6403,\r HTSUSA, it becomes an issue.\r\r      To determine whether the Flight boots are \""sports\""\r footwear, we look subheading legal note 1 to Chapter 64 which\r outlines the features found on sports footwear.  Note 1\r provides first that the item should be designed for a sporting\r activity and that such footwear have or have provision for the\r attachment cleats, spikes, or the like.  In addition, the note\r sets out a list of footwear that would be classified as sports\r footwear.  We believe that the list is neither exclusive, nor\r intended to merely provide examples of the footwear described\r in the first part of the note.  Numerous types of sports\r footwear may fit the description of the note (for example\r baseball cleats or track spikes) but are not listed.  In\r addition, not all of the examples have attachments or provision\r for attachment of spikes, cleats, etc (wrestling boots, boxing\r boots).\r\r      If footwear is designed for a specific sporting activity,\r if it is not well suited for general athletic purposes (as\r \""athletic footwear\"" would be), and if it is used primarily for\r the specific activity for which it is designed, then we are of\r the opinion that it should be classified as sports footwear.\r In this case, special design is evidenced by the attributes we\r noted above, many of which also indicate that the boots are not\r susceptible to general cold weather outdoor use.  For example\r the rigid sole may aid in the control of the snowboard, but\r makes walking and casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> unlikely.  We believe that these\r boots will be used primarily for snowboarding.\r\r      Lastly, we do not find that boots such as these are \""ski-\r boots.\""  Following the above reasoning, the boots here do not\r exhibit the design features found on either downhill or cross-\r country ski-boots.  They do not have heel and toe projections\r required for insertion into quick release bindings on downhill\r skis.  They are lighter and much more flexible across the arch\r than downhill ski boots.  However, they do not possess the\r flexibility necessary for telemarking or cross-country skiing.\r While the term \""ski-boot\"" cannot be defined too rigidly, and\r tariff terms may properly include newly developed variants of\r traditional articles, we find that the boots at issue here are\r too dissimilar to be classified under the provision for ski\r boots.\r\r      Subheading 6403.19, HTSUSA, provides for sports footwear,\r other.  Because your letter did not indicate whether the boots\r are for \""men, youth or boys\"", we cannot provide an exact\r classification ruling.  The boots will however be classified in\r provision under subheading 6403.19, HTSUSA.\r\r HOLDING:\r\r      The boots described as the Alpine style are classified in\r subheading 6404.11.90, HTSUSA, as <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> with outer soles of\r\r\r plastics and uppers of textile materials, sports footwear,\r valued over $12 per pair.  They are dutiable at the rate of 20\r percent ad valorem.\r\r      The boots described as the Flight style are classified in\r subheading 6403.19, HTSUSA, as footwear with outer soles of\r plastics and uppers of leather, other sports footwear.  The\r duty rate on these goods is dependent on whether they are\r designed for use by men, youths and boys or by other\r individuals.\r\r\r                                    Sincerely,\r\r\r                                    John A.

Both of these shoes exhibit certain characteristics associated with athletic footwear, i.e. a foxing or foxing-like band, a rubber or plastics toe bumper and a general athletic appearance.  However, each shoe has a wedge insole which you state renders them incapable of fast <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> work and unsafe for anything but casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  You also state that they are not marketed as tennis shoes.  You provided an F.O.B. value over $12/pair and suggest classification under subheading 6404.19.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for in pertinent part; non-athletic footwear.  We agree with this suggested classification.\r\rThe submitted half-pair sample identified as style number 63720 OLV “Moc Toe Lace Up,” is a  lace-up “casual” shoe with a rubber or plastics outer sole and a textile upper that does not cover the ankle.  The shoe has non-removable lacing on each side of the upper (similar to what would be found on a moccasin) and a foxing or foxing-like band.  It does not have a padded collar or tongue, a rubber or plastics toe bumper and is not athletic in appearance.  You provided an F.O.B. value over $12/pair. \r\rThe applicable subheading for style numbers 39103 BLK, 39105 ORG and 63720 OLV will be 6404.19.90, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or  composition leather and uppers of textile materials: other: other: valued over $12/pair.  The rate of duty will be 9% ad valorem. \r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.  The text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on World Wide Web at http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/.\r\rIn reference to style number 39103 BLK, you state that a circular logo with the words “Born in LA” will be attached to the upper side wall of the sneaker.  You question whether this will violate the country of origin rules for marking.  \r\rSection 134.46 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 134.46) provides that in any case where the words “U.S.,” “American,” or any variation of such words or letters, or the name of any city or locality in the U.S., or the name of any foreign country or locality other than the country or locality in which the article was manufactured or produced, appear on any imported article or its container, there shall appear, legibly and permanently, in close proximity to such words, letters or name, and at least in a comparable size, the name of the country of origin preceded by “Made in,” “Product of,” or other words of similar meaning.  In order to satisfy the close proximity requirement, the country of origin marking must generally appear on the same side(s) or surfaces(s) in which the name or locality other than the actual country of origin appears.\r\rSection 134.47 provides as follows:  When as part of a trademark or trade name or as part of a souvenir marking, the name of a location in the United States or “United States” or “America” appear, the article shall be legibly, conspicuously, and permanently marked to indicate the name of the country of origin of the article preceded by “Made in,” “Product of,” or other similar words, in close proximity or in some other conspicuous location. The purpose of 19 CFR 134.46 and 134.47 is to prevent the ultimate purchaser from being misled or deceived when the name of a country or place other than the country of origin appears on an imported article or its container.  The sample is not marked and your letter doesn’t say where you intend to place the country of origin marking.  In addition, you do not make reference to any trademark or trade name.  \r\rConsequently, the sneaker with the logo attached to its side in the manner described by you will not sufficiently satisfy the requirements of these regulations and will render its importation not legally marked.\r\rThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\rA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

The external surface area of the uppers is composed of plastic glitter which completely obscures the underlying base.  A decorative textile bow is secured to the vamp of each shoe with minimal stitching, the removal of which would not render the shoes unserviceable.  Consequently, the bows are considered to be “loosely attached appurtenances” and are excluded from external surface area measurement.  You suggest classification in Chapter 95, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for toys, games and sports equipment; parts and accessories thereof.  We disagree with this classification pursuant to GRI 1, HTSUS, which states in pertinent part, “classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.” \r\rThe applicable subheading for Item #70725, girl’s slip-on shoes will be 6402.99.3171, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics: other footwear: other: other: having uppers of which over 90% of the external surface area (including accessories or reinforcements) is rubber or plastics: other: other: other: other.  The rate of duty will be 6% ad valorem.\r\rThe submitted sample which you identify as Item #89644 “Fancy Nancy Fuchsia,” is a pair of girl’s closed toe/open heel slip-on shoes with outer soles composed of rubber/plastics.  The external surface area of the uppers is composed predominately of textile materials (exclusive of a decorative textile flower attached to the vamp) with plastic sequins interspersed along the sides and surrounding the top-line of the shoes.  You also suggest classification in Chapter 95, HTSUS, which provides for toys, games and sports equipment; parts and accessories thereof.  We also disagree with this classification pursuant to GRI 1, HTSUS.       \r\rThe applicable subheading for Item #89644, girl’s slip-on shoes will be 6404.19.3580, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: footwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners: not less than 10 percent by weight of rubber or plastics; other: other.  The rate of duty will be 37.5% ad valorem. \r\rThe submitted samples which you identify as Item #’s 70726 and 70126 “Fancy Nancy Exquisite Ballet Slippers” and “Fancy Nancy Bonjour Butterfly Slippers,” respectively, are pairs of girl’s slippers with outer soles composed of 100% brushed fabric and uppers of 100% polyester woven fabric.  The vamp portion of each upper features a pendant with a framed photograph of the “Fancy Nancy” character.  The slippers, which resemble ballet shoes, are designed to be worn by girls ages three and older who wish to engage in “dress-up” activity.  They are neither available in assorted sizes nor do they have a right and left designation and are of flimsy construction that would render them unsuitable for any form of practical <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> by children.  The retail packages they are sold in include a pair of leg warmers and a child’s bracelet, respectively.  These packages do not constitute a “set” for tariff purposes because they are not put up together to meet a particular need or activity.  Although one may presume the intention of these products is for dress-up, the potential to create a specific look is not evident.   \r\rThe bracelet is composed of plastic beads and an artificial flower with dangling ribbons.  It will be classified under subheading 7117.90.9000, HTSUS, which provides for imitation jewelry: valued over 20 cents per dozen pieces or parts: other: other.  The rate of duty will be 11% ad valorem.\r\rThe leg warmers are constructed of woven man made fabric and will be classified under subheading 6217.10.9530, HTSUS, which provides for other made up clothing accessories; parts of garments or of clothing accessories, accessories: other: other: of man made fibers.

If a person has a prosthetic limb or is wearing a cast for a fractured limb, they cannot get it wet or the water will damage the cast or the prosthesis.  This product allows them to shower, bathe or even swim.  Most importantly, people with prosthetic limbs have traditionally had to take off their limb and manoeuvre themselves (with some difficulty), into a shower containing a chair for them to sit on in order to shower.  By using this product they can leave their prosthetic leg on and simply shower like anyone else.  This gives them better mobility and enhances safety in this situation.  The leg unit has a rubberised non-slip sole.” \r\r\tPer the XeroxSox web site the waterproofness is achieved in the following manner:  “Pump out the air - Continue to press the bulb until it remains flat and the XeroSox waterproof clothing is completely wrinkled.  Remove the pump and push on the safety cap.  Observe the XeroSox waterproof cast and bandage cover for a few minutes before going in the water.  As long as the XeroxSox wasterproof clothing stays collapsed and wrinkled, the vacuum is intact and the XeroSox bandage protector cannot leak or come off.”\r\r\tThe XeroSox web site describes it as a “Waterproof Cast and Bandage Cover.”  However, we accept the implication in your description that covering bandages is a relatively minor use.  Bandages on the arms and legs are not usually left on the patient as long as a cast and many are themselves waterproof so the issue of keeping them dry during bathing, etc, is less likely to arise, especially for any one patient.  \r\r\tThe web site indicates that you recommend that they be removed after 45 minutes of use, due to the reduction in blood flow resulting from the squeezing inherent in the process, which further distinguishes them from gloves or footwear in the common meaning of those terms even though they also cover the hand or the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Also, they are normally worn in bathtubs, etc., where gloves and footwear are virtually never worn, and they would virtually never be worn as a pair.  \r\t \r\tSince the XeroSox covers and adds the property of temporary waterproofness to casts and/or prosthetics, we consider them to be identifiable as suitable for use as accessories solely or principally with the apparatus of HTS 9021.  They are not covered, per se, by any of the headings cited in Note 2-a to HTS Chapter 90.  \r\r\tWithin 9021, it is clear that the arm version, in terms of HTS, Additional US Rules of Interpretation 1-a, is of a class or kind principally used in the US with the orthopedic and fracture appliances of HTS 9021.10.  However, the leg version may or may not be principally used with the artificial parts of the body of 9021.31-.39. \r  \r\tWe agree that the applicable subheading for the arm version will be 9021.10.0090, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for “other” orthopedic or fracture appliances, and parts and accessories thereof.  \t\t\r\r\tYou state, “I was advised to contact you by Lisa Struneski, Senior Commercial Specialist, FCS New Zealand.  I would appreciate your help in knowing what you would regard as an appropriate Harmonisation Tariff Code for a product.”.  Note that only the classification rulings issued by the Harmonized System Committee of the World Trade Organization, of which both the US and New Zealand are members, are binding on other countries, not the rulings of any one of the members, including the US.   \r\r\tRegarding the leg version, we are returning your request for a classification ruling, and any related samples, exhibits, etc., because we need additional information in order to issue a ruling.  Please submit the additional information indicated below:\r\r\tAny information that would indicate separately what percent were sold for use with casts and with prosthetic devices. \r\r Also include a statement as to whether classification advice has been sought from a US Customs officer; and if so, from whom, and what advice was rendered, if any.\r\r\tWhen this information is available, you may wish to consider resubmission of your request regarding the leg version.

Rasco\rMetro\r1Lincoln Blvd., Suite 202  \rRouses Point, NY  12979\r\rRE:  The tariff classification of footwear from China and Canada\r\rDear Ms. Rasco:\r\rIn your letter dated March 28, 2013 you requested a tariff classification ruling on behalf of your client, Stonz <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Wear</span> Inc., for two boots.\r\rThe submitted sample (no style name/number provided), is a pair of children’s “unisex” waterproof rain boots which cover the ankle but not the knee.  The outer soles and uppers are rubber or plastics and the insides are lined with cotton textile material.  The boots are assembled by cementing/vulcanization.   \r\rThe applicable subheading for the children’s “unisex” waterproof rain boots (no style name/number provided), will be 6401.92.9060, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for waterproof footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics, the uppers of which are neither fixed to the sole nor assembled by stitching, riveting, nailing, screwing, plugging or similar processes: other footwear: covering the ankle but not covering the knee: other: other: other.  The general rate of duty will be 37.5% ad valorem. \u000B\rThe submitted sample (no style name/number provided) is a pair of women’s “winter” boots which have molded rubber or plastics bottoms that cover the sides and tops of the feet.  Stitched to each bottom is a textile “shaft” which covers the ankle and predominates as the constituent material having the greatest external surface area of the upper.  Each upper has both a hook and loop and a drawstring closure at the front and back of the top line, respectively, and a two-piece strap closure across the instep.  You suggest classification under subheading 6404.19.9060, HTSUS, which provides for footwear that is not designed to be worn over, or in lieu of, other footwear as a protection against water, oil grease or chemicals or cold or inclement weather.  We disagree with this suggested classification.\r\rCustoms has previously ruled that footwear with a molded rubber or plastics bottom which covers the sides and top of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> (known in the industry as a “bean boot bottom”), is substantially more of a protection against those elements, i.e. water, than the usual footwear of that type.  Therefore, we consider the sample boots to be protective against water.   \r\rThe applicable subheading for the women’s “winter” boots will be 6404.19.2060, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: which is not “sports” or “athletic” footwear; footwear designed to be worn over, or in lieu of, other footwear as a protection against water, oil, grease or chemicals or cold or inclement weather: for women.  The general rate of duty will be 37.5% ad valorem.  \r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.  The text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on World Wide Web at http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/.\r\rPlease note that each of the women’s sample winter boots has a label stitched to its lateral side with the trademark or trade name “STONZ” imprinted on it and CANADA imprinted below it.  This method of marking is not considered proper marking for this item.  \r\rTitle 19 C.F.R. Section 134.47 states; “When as part of a trademark or trade name or as part of a souvenir marking, the name of a location in the United States or “United States” or “America” appear, the article shall be legibly, conspicuously, and permanently marked to indicate the name of the country of origin of the article preceded by “Made in,” “Product of,” or other similar words, in close proximity or in some other conspicuous location.”   \r\rIn addition, the adhesive label “Made in China” on the inside of each of the children’s rain boots is not permanent and therefore, not considered proper marking.  Title 19 C.F.R. Section 134.11 states; “every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit, in such manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the U.S. the English name of the country of origin of the article.”  Therefore, if imported as is, the rain boots will not meet the country of origin marking requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1304.\r\rThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\rA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

Silverman\rGrunfeld, Desiderio, Lebowitz, Silverman & Klestatd LLP\r599 Lexington Ave, 36th floor\rNew York, NY 10022\r                       \rRE:  \tRevocation of NY N295514; Classification of the Latex Rubber Boot Saver\r\rDear Mr. Silverman:\r\rThis is in response to your January 31, 2019 letter, filed on behalf of Tingley Rubber Corporation (“Tingley”), requesting modification of New York Ruling Letter (“NY”) N295514, dated April 25, 2018.  In NY N295514, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”)  classified certain disposable latex shoe/boot covers under subheading 6401.92.9060, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”), which provides for “waterproof footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics, the uppers of which are neither fixed to the sole nor assembled by stitching, riveting, nailing, screwing, plugging or similar processes: other footwear: covering the ankle but not covering the knee: other: other: other.”  \r\rOn November 26, 2018, you filed a request for modification of NY N295514, asserting classification under subheading 6401.99.30, HTSUS, which provides for “waterproof footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics, the uppers of which are neither fixed to the sole nor assembled by stitching, riveting, nailing, screwing, plugging or similar processes: other footwear: other: other: designed to be worn over, or in lieu of, other footwear as a protection against water, oil, grease or chemicals or cold or inclement weather: designed for use without closures.”  On January 31, 2019, you amended your request asserting classification under subheading 3926.90.9990, HTSUS, as “other articles of plastics and articles of other materials of headings 3901 to 3914: other: other: other,” or alternatively, under 6401.99.30, HTSUS. \r\rPursuant to section 625(c)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. § 1625(c)(1)), as amended by section 623 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. No. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186 (1993), notice of the proposed action was published on July 3, 2019, in Volume 53, Number 22, of the Customs Bulletin.  One comment, which will be addressed below, was received in response to this notice.\r\rFACTS:\t\r\r\tThe product at issue is a disposable, ambidextrous, unisex, shoe/boot cover, identified as the Latex Rubber Boot Saver (the “Boot Saver”).  The Boot Saver, a product of Thailand, is made of powder-free natural latex rubber with acid-dipped bottoms.  The manufacturing process involves aluminum formers being dipped twice into latex and once into dilute acetic acid.  The first dip coats the former with latex.  The second dip coats only the lower portion of the former with an additional layer of latex to create a durable bottom/sole.  The bottom portion is then dipped a third time in dilute acetic acid, which textures the surface for improved slip resistance.  The Boot Savers are meant to be worn over regular shoes or boots by people in food processing facilities to protect the facility from cross-contamination.  They come in four sizes (medium, large, extra large, and extra extra large) and four colors (yellow, red, blue, and black). \r\rYou submitted two samples: an extra large yellow Boot Saver and a large black Boot Saver over a size 13 Tingley brand, Triumph, waterproof boot.\r\rISSUE: \r\r\tWhether the Latex Rubber Boot Saver imported by Tingley Rubber Corporation is classified under subheading 3926.90.9990, HTSUS, 6401.99.3000, HTSUS, or 6401.92.9060 HTSUS.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUS is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (“GRI”).  GRI 1 provides that classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  Where goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, the remaining GRIs will be applied in their appropriate order.\r\rThe HTSUS subheadings under consideration are as follows:\r\r3926:\t\tOther articles of plastics and articles of other materials of headings 3901 to 3914:\r3926.90:\t\tOther:\r3926.90.99:\t\t\tOther… \r3926.90.9990:\t\t\t\tOther…\r*\t*\t*\t*\r6401:  \tWaterproof footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics, the uppers of which are neither fixed to the sole nor assembled by stitching, riveting, nailing, screwing, plugging or similar processes:\rOther footwear:\r6401.92:\t\t\tCovering the ankle but not covering the knee:\r\t\t\t\t\tOther:\r6401.92.90:\t\t\t\t\tOther… \r6401.92.9060:\t\t\t\t\t\tOther…\r6401.99:\t\t\tOther:\r\t\t\t\t\tOther:\rDesigned to be worn over, or in lieu of, other footwear as a protection against water, oil, grease or chemicals or cold or inclement weather:\r6401.99.3000:\t\t\t\t\t\tDesigned for use without closures…\r*\t*\t*\t*\rNote 2 to Chapter 39 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\rThis chapter does not cover:\rArticles of section XII (for example, footwear, headgear, umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, riding-crops or parts thereof);\r*\t*\t*\t*\rNote 1 to Chapter 64 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\rThis chapter does not cover:\rDisposable <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> or shoe coverings of flimsy material (for example, paper, sheeting of plastics) without applied soles.  These products are classified according to their constituent material;\r*\t*\t*\t*\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (“ENs”) constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.  See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rThe EN to Chapter 64 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\rGENERAL\r\rWith certain exceptions (see particularly those mentioned at the end of this General Note) this Chapter covers, under headings 64.01 to 64.05, various types of footwear (including overshoes) irrespective of their shape and size, the particular use for which they are designed, their method of manufacture or the materials of which they are made.\r\rFor the purposes of this Chapter, the term “footwear” does not, however, include disposable <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> or shoe coverings of flimsy material (paper, sheeting of plastics, etc.) without applied soles.  These products are classified according to their constituent material.\r\r[…]  The Chapter includes:\r…\r(10) Disposable footwear, with applied soles, generally designed to be used only once.\r*\t*\t*\t*\r\rPursuant to Note 1(a) to Chapter 64, a disposable shoe covering made of flimsy material and lacking an applied sole is precluded from classification as footwear of Chapter 64, HTSUS.  You argue that pursuant to Note 1(a), the Boot Saver is precluded from classification in Chapter 64, HTSUS, because it is a disposable shoe cover, made of flimsy material, without an applied sole.  You therefore assert that the Boot Saver should be classified according to its constituent material under subheading 3926.90.9990, HTSUS.  \r\rYou argue that the Boot Saver’s material is flimsy because it is designed for limited use and must be disposed of to prevent ripping.  You assert that even flimsy products must be durable enough to serve a one-time limited use.  To support this, you cite several CBP rulings concerning the classification of Halloween costumes in Chapter 95, HTSUS.  We note that the merchandise in those rulings is substantially different than the shoe covers at issue.  In fact, CBP has consistently determined that disposable latex shoe covers, similar to the Boot Savers, are not flimsy pursuant to Chapter 64, Note 1(a), HTSUS, despite being intended for a one-time limited use.  See NY M86014 (Sept. 8, 2006); NY L81039 (Dec. 13, 2004); and, NY E81872 (June 8, 1999).  Moreover, the Oxford English Dictionary defines “flimsy” as “insubstantial and easily damaged.”  See https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/flimsy (accessed May 15, 2019).  The Boot Saver’s latex rubber material is strong and stretchy, and does not tear or rip when pushing a finger through it with little effort.  Accordingly, we find that the Boot Saver’s latex rubber material is not flimsy.\r\rAs per the General Explanatory Note, Chapter 64 includes disposable footwear, generally designed to be used only once, if it has an applied sole.  You argue that the Boot Savers do not have applied soles because they are made from a single component of latex rubber and there are no detachable parts.  Whether footwear has an applied sole pursuant to Note 1(a) depends on whether a “line of demarcation” between the outer sole and the upper can be identified.  See Headquarters Ruling Letter (“HQ”) H246161 (Sept. 12, 2016); HQ H241512 (July 07, 2014); and, HQ 956921 (Nov. 22, 1994).  The samples show a clear line of demarcation where the outer sole’s rough surface meets the upper’s smooth surface.  You cite HQ H241512, which indicated that footwear made of a single material, with no additional, applied layer or covering on the bottom, does not have a line of demarcation distinguishing the sole from the remainder of the item.  The Boot Savers, while made from a single material, have two additional, distinguishable, applied layers on the bottoms: a second coating of latex and a texturized outer sole.  Your product specification sheet even states that “[t]he gap between the 2nd layer of latex and the acid texturing should target 5 mm” and “[t]he lines of the second dip and acid etching should be visually parallel with the shoe bottom edge.”  These are clearly noticeable on the samples.  Due to the distinguishable outer soles and line of demarcation, we find that the Boot Savers have applied soles.\r\rCBP has consistently determined that one-piece latex shoe/boot covers with roughed up outer soles have applied soles pursuant to Note 1(a) to Chapter 64, HTSUS.  See NY N171055 (July 12, 2011); NY E85883 (Sept. 13, 1999); and, NY E81872 (June 8, 1999).  In your request, you cite several rulings including NY N266909, dated August 10, 2015, NY D86071, dated January 20, 1999, and NY N171076, dated June 21, 2011, all of which classify various disposable shoe coverings.  In your discussion of NY N266909, you reference the styles KBSB “Super Nonskid, Waterproof Shoe Covers-Super Bootie” and the KBE “Economy Short <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Wear</span>,” neither of which CBP found classifiable in Chapter 64, HTSUS.  However, in that ruling, CBP did classify style KBCP “Extra Durable” in Chapter 64, HTSUS, noting that blue-colored chlorinated polyethylene, which covered all but the top 2.5 inches of the white textile material, was a clearly defined outer sole.  We find that the Boot Saver, having a distinct rough outer sole, is more analogous to the KBCP “Extra Durable” than the styles you refer to.  Similarly, you cite NY D86071, asserting that the Boot Savers are analogous to latex booties stock #1525Y and #1525B, which were classified under subheading 4016.99.35, HTSUS.  However, we note that the Boot Savers, having rough soles, are more akin to stock #LB1250, a latex bootie with a ridged sole that CBP classified under subheading 6401.92.90, HTSUS.  In reference to NY N171076, you include pictures of the subject shoe cover.  The pictures show no clear line of demarcation, unlike the Boot Savers.  \r\rIn accordance with the above, we find that Boot Savers are classifiable as footwear in Chapter 64, HTSUS, pursuant to Note 1(a), because they are not flimsy and have applied soles.  You argue that the Boot Savers should be classified according to their constituent material under Chapter 39, HTSUS.  However, we have determined that the Boot Savers are articles of Section XII as footwear, and are therefore precluded from classification in Chapter 39, HTSUS, by application of Note 2(q).  \r\rBecause we find that the Boot Saver is classifiable in Chapter 64, HTSUS, we consider your alternative claim that the Boot Saver should be classified under subheading 6401.99.30, HTSUS, as waterproof footwear with uppers and soles of rubber/plastic which do not cover the ankle.  Whether the Boot Saver is classified under subheading 6401.92.9060 or 6401.99.30 depends on whether it covers the ankle.  A representative of your firm visited the National Commodity Specialist Division in New York to demonstrate that the Boot Saver did not cover his anklebone when worn over regular shoes.  Based on the observation of the National Import Specialist and our own examination of the samples, we find that the Boot Savers do not cover the ankle.  Therefore, the Latex Rubber Boot Saver is classified under subheading 6401.99.30, HTSUS.\r\r\tIn the comment we received, the commenter proposed that the Latex Rubber Boot Saver should be classified under subheading 6401.99.80, HTSUS, which provides for “waterproof footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics, the uppers of which are neither fixed to the sole nor assembled by stitching, riveting, nailing, screwing, plugging or similar processes; other footwear: other: other: other: having upper’s of which over 90 percent of the external surface area (including any accessories or reinforcements such as those mentioned in note 4(a) to this chapter) is rubber or plastics (except footwear having foxing or a foxing-like band applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper).  In particular, the commenter claimed that the Boot Saver should not be considered protective because they protect the work space from contamination rather than the wearer’s footwear.  \r\rIn support of its argument, the commenter relied on NY N304851, dated July 16, 2019, which classified a closed toe/closed heel, one piece molded, 100% rubber, slip-on overshoe, identified as the “Easy Max”, in subheading 6401.99.80, HTSUS.  Although the “Easy Max” was designed to prevent slipping on oil, wet, or greasy floors, it did not cover the top of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and was not considered protective.  CBP does not consider footwear that leaves the top of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> exposed to be protective.  See NY N281317 (Dec. 21, 2016); and NY N271998 (Feb. 11, 2016).  Unlike the “Easy Max”, the Boot Saver covers the top of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The fact that the Boot Saver is used to prevent cross-contamination in the workplace does not preclude it from protecting the wearer’s footwear as well.  Furthermore, the amended request states, “[t]he Boot Saver's latex material allows the shoe cover to adequately protect the wearer's shoe for a limited time.”  Therefore, we are not persuaded by the commenter’s assertion that the Boot Savers are not protective.  Having considered the submitted comment, CBP finds that the Latex Rubber Boot Saver remains classified under subheading 6401.99.30, HTSUS.\r\rHOLDING:\r\t\rBy application of GRI 1, we find that the Latex Rubber Boot Saver in NY N295514 is classified under subheading 6401.99.30, HTSUS, which provides for “Waterproof footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics, the uppers of which are neither fixed to the sole nor assembled by stitching, riveting, nailing, screwing, plugging or similar processes: Other footwear: Other: Other: Designed to be worn over, or in lieu of, other footwear as a protection against water, oil, grease or chemicals or cold or inclement weather: Designed for use without closures.”  The 2019 column one duty rate is 25% ad valorum.\r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and subject to change.

You provided MSDS sheets, percent by weight component breakdowns and two sample containers labeled Parts A and B for review. Your samples are being returned. \r\rECOBICO is described as a two part water based aliphatic polyisocyanate protective coating system for floors. ECOBICO ECMT-TFL08-A (Part A polymer) is a white water based liquid mixture in a plastic container with screw-off cap (820 grams). ECOBICO ECMT-TFL08-B (Part B crosslinker) is a transparent hexamethylene diisocyanate polymer based liquid mixture in a metal tin with twist-off top and pour spout (180 grams). Part A and Part B come in the correct ratio for mixing on site. Part B is slowly and completely added to Part A by pouring and stirring for 5 minutes. The product is left to stand for 15 minutes then applied to the floor surface by using a roller or a brush. The first coating may be followed by a second and then a third at 5-7 hour intervals. The product forms a brilliant non-yellowing and non-slip plastic film that resists the dirt and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> of <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> traffic. \r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) constitute the official interpretation of the HTSUS.

You provided MSDS sheets, percent by weight component breakdowns and two sample containers with printed paper labels for our review. Your samples are being returned. \r\rECOBICO is described as a two part water based aliphatic polyisocyanate protective coating system for floors. ECOBICO Part A (polymer) is a transparent hexamethylene diisocyanate polymer based liquid mixture in a plastic container with screw-off cap (820 grams). ECOBICO Part B (crosslinker) is a white water based liquid mixture in a metal tin with twist-off top and pour spout (180 grams). Part A and Part B come in the correct ratio for mixing on site. Part B is slowly and completely added to Part A by pouring and stirring for 5 minutes. The product is left to stand for 15 minutes then applied to the floor surface by using a roller or a brush. The first coating may be followed by a second and then a third at 5-7 hour intervals. The product forms a brilliant non-yellowing and non-slip plastic film that resists the dirt and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> of <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> traffic. \r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) constitute the official interpretation of the HTSUS. While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings at the international level. See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127 (Aug. 23, 1989). EN 39.11 (4) (a) is relevant to your product and provides for: Polyureas based on hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), synthesised by the reaction of HDI with water to produce prepolymers with an average number of monomer units of between 3 and 4. The products are used in the manufacture of paints and varnishes. Your product consisting of hexamethylene diisocyanate polymer and hexamethylene diisocyanate monomer intended to be crosslinked by the reaction with a water based crosslinker to produce a floor coating meets the description for polyureas in EN 39.11 (4) (a).\r\rSection VII Note 1., HTSUS, is relevant to products imported as two part system and provides: Goods put up in sets consisting of two or more separate constituents, some or all of which fall in this section and are intended to be mixed together to obtain a product of section VI or section VII, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the product, provided the constituents are: (a) Having regard to the manner in which they are put up, clearly identifiable as being intended to be used together without first being repacked; (b) Entered together; and (c) Identifiable as being complimentary one to another. Your product, which is a two part coating system imported in the correct ratio for mixing on site, meets the requirements of Section VII Note one for sets.\r\rThe applicable subheading for the two part water based polyisocyanate floor coating system imported in the correct ratio for mixing on site will be 3911.90.9010, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for: Petroleum resins, coumarone-indene resins, polyterpenes, polysulfides, polysulfones and other products specified in note 3 to this chapter, not elsewhere specified or included, in primary forms: Other: Other: Other: Other: Thermoplastic.

Macy Corporate Buying\rEleven Penn Plaza\rNew York, New York  10001\r\rRE: Classification of two women's knit garments for the lower\r    torso and legs; tights, 6115, v. trousers, 6104\r\rDear Mr. Khem:\r\r     This ruling is in response to your letter of June 20, 1991,\rrequesting the classification of two styles of garments which\rwill be manufactured in Taiwan.  The garments will be entered\rthrough the ports of San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and\rPhiladelphia.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The garments at issue, styles 503 and 504, are described in\ryour letter as exercise tights.  The garments are made of fine\rknit fabric consisting of 54 percent cotton, 36 percent polyester\rand 10 percent lycra fibers.  The fabric weighs 320 grams per\ryard.  Both garments feature a gusset in the crotch, center seams\rin the front and back lower torso portion of the garments, seams\ralong the inside of the legs and hemmed leg openings.  Style 503\ris ankle-length, has an 1/4-inch wide elasticized self-fabric\rwaistband and is hemmed in a manner which creates the appearance\rof a fabric band at the bottom of each leg.  Style 504 is calf-\rlength and has a one-inch wide elasticized self-fabric waistband.\r\r     You have requested classification of the garments as tights\rof heading 6115, HTSUSA, with a 359 textile category designation.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Are the garments at issue, styles 503 and 504, classifiable\ras tights of heading 6115, HTSUSA, or as trousers of heading\r6104, HTSUSA?\r                               -2-\r\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, provided such\rheadings or notes do not otherwise require, according to [the\rremaining GRIs taken in order].\""\r\r     You identify the submitted garments as tights, however, the\rgarments are similar to garments known commercially as leggings\rand previously ruled upon by Customs.  See, HRL 088454 of October\r11, 1991.  Leggings are relatively new creations of the fashion\rindustry, as is the use of the term \""leggings\"" to describe them.\rThe term \""leggings\"" by which they are known commercially was not\rin wide-spread use when the current tariff was adopted.  However,\rthe tariff does contain a provision which includes leggings,\ri.e., heading 6406, HTSUSA, which provides for, inter alia,\rgaiters, leggings and similar articles.  The garments at issue\rherein are not the leggings which are classifiable in heading\r6406, HTSUSA.  [For further discussion see, HRL 088454].\r\r     In determining the proper classification of the garments at\rissue, two headings clearly merit consideration.  These are\rheading 6104, HTSUSA, which provides for, inter alia, trousers,\rbreeches and shorts, and heading 6115, HTSUSA, which provides\rfor, inter alia, tights.\r\r     It is a well-established tenet of customs law that tariff\rterms are construed in accordance with their common and\rcommercial meanings and that the common meaning of a tariff term\ris a question of law.  Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. United\rStates, 7 CIT 178, 182, 585 F. Supp. 649 (1984), aff'd, 753 F.2d\r1061 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\r\r     The HTSUSA and the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized\rSystem are silent on the meaning of the term tights.  However,\rtrousers are defined in the Explanatory Notes as:\r\r     garments which envelop each leg separately, covering the\r     knees and usually reaching down to or below the ankles;\r     these garments usually stop at the waist; the presence of\r     braces does not cause these garments to lose the essential\r     character of trousers.\r\r     Heading 6115, HTSUSA, provides, in full, for panty hose,\rtights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings\rfor varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted\ror crocheted.  As the tariff is silent regarding the meaning of\rtights, it is reasonable and proper to look to lexicographic\r                               -3-\r\r\rsources.  The statutory canon of construction \""noscitur a sociis\""\ris useful in determining the common and commercial meaning of the\rterm tights.  Accordingly, Customs has researched various\rlexicographic sources to discern the common meaning of trousers\rand of tights, hose and hosiery.  The following pertinent\rdefinitions were found.\r\r     TROUSERS\r\r          An outer garment of men or boys, extending from the\r          waist to the knee or, oftener and almost always with\r          men, to the ankle, and covering each leg separately.\r          Orig. they were of the nature of long hose or tight\r          drawers and were worn esp. by sailors and soldiers.\r          Webster's New International Dictionary, Unabridged\r          (2nd Ed., 1939)\r\r          A usually loose-fitting outer garment for the lower\r          part of the body, having individual leg portions that\r          reach typically to the ankle but sometimes to any of\r          various other points from the upper leg down, worn esp.\r          by men and boys.

We do not believe the garments at issue herein,\rrepresented by the submitted sample, are a form of hosiery.  In\rMast Industries v. United States, 9 CIT 549, 552 (1985), aff'd,\r786 F. 2d 1144 (1986), the court noted, citing United States v.\rBruce Duncan Co., 50 CCPA 43, 46, C.A.D. 817 (1963), \""the\rmerchandise itself may be strong evidence of use.\""  The sample\rgarment is form-fitting and covers the lower torso and legs,\rhowever, upon examination Customs believes it to be more in the\rnature of trousers, than hosiery.  The above-cited definitions of\rtrousers indicate that they are garments which cover the lower\rtorso from the waist to the ankle or, sometimes, simply to the\rknee, and cover each leg separately.  At least one definition\rabove illustrates that trousers may be close-fitting depending on\rthe fashion.  Additionally, Customs notes that although the cited\rdefinitions refer to trousers as garments worn especially by men\ror boys, women too <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> trousers.  Therefore, it would appear\rthat the garments at issue are within the definition of trousers,\rincluding the definition contained in the Explanatory Notes of\rthe Harmonized System.\r\r     The meaning of the term tights was examined by the Customs\rCourt in Children's Hose Inc., v. United States, 55 Cust. Ct. 6,\rC.D. 2547 (1965).  In that case, the court stated:\r\r     [T]he court may take judicial notice of the fact that\r     leotards or tights whether worn by children or women are\r     designed to be at least partially utilized under an\r     outergarment and partially exposed, depending upon the age\r     of the wearer and the purpose for which they are worn.  It\r     would, therefore, seem that if a portion of this imported\r     merchandise is underwear, a portion of it is not underwear.\r     By the same token, while the exposed portion may be\r     outerwear, the portion concealed would not be outerwear.\r     Therefore, the articles at bar are more than underwear and\r     more than outerwear.  They are, therefore, in fact \""neither\r     fish nor fowl.\""  (at 9 and 10)\r\rIt is clear from the language of the court, that tights are\rgarments which are partially underwear and partially outerwear.\rThe extent to which the garment is exposed to view is dependent\rupon the age of the wearer and the purpose for which the garment\r                               -6-\r\r\ris worn.  This interpretation would follow some of the previously\rcited definitions for tights which describe them as knitted pants\rand stockings in one piece or underpants and stockings knit in\rone piece.\r\r     In United States v. Great Pacific Co., Shui Tai & Co., 23\rCCPA 319, 324, T.D. 48192, the court stated:\r\r     A common meaning, having been once established and\r     determined by a court, will be presumed to continue until\r     the language is changed by subsequent legislation.\r\rHowever, the tariff schedules in force at the time of Children's\rHose did not have a provision for tights as the current tariff\rdoes, nor did it have a provision for trousers.  Therefore, while\rthe determination of the court regarding the meaning of the term\rtights and the manner in which they are designed to be worn is\rinstructive in this case, it is not determinative because the\rterm tights was not part of the statutory language of the tariff\rat the time of Children's Hose.  The meaning of an eo nomine\rclassification is determined as of the time of the enactment of\rthe tariff provision.  FAG Bearings, Ltd. v. United States, 9 CIT\r227, 228 (1985)  In this case, the HTSUSA (of which heading 6115\rwhich provides for tights is part) was enacted as part of the\rOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, P.L. 100-418,\rTitle I, sec. 1201, 102 Stat. 1147 (1988), and became effective\ron January 1, 1989.  Nonetheless, Customs does not believe the\rcommon meaning of the term tights changed much between 1965 and\r1989.\r\r     In deciding if the subject garments are within the eo\rnomine classification for tights, Customs may consider the use of\rthe merchandise.  United States v. Quon Quon Co., 46 CCPA 70, 73,\rC.A.D. 699 (1959).  Customs interprets the use of the merchandise\rto include the manner in which it is worn as well as the reasons\rfor which it is worn.\r\r     Customs recognizes that the garments at issue herein belong\rto a class of garments known commercially as leggings.  These\rgarments are generally worn in conjunction with a garment which\rjust barely covers the lower torso, i.e., reaches just below the\rhip area.  Consequently, the portion of the leggings which covers\rthe lower torso is exposed to view as the wearer reaches or bends\ror moves about in the course of normal activity.  Additionally,\rthese garments are not always worn with a garment which covers\rthe lower torso.  They may be worn without such a garment\raccording to the discretion of the wearer.  Customs believes the\rdonning of another garment to cover the lower torso when wearing\rleggings such as the garments at issue is a function of fashion\rand the personal perception of the individual regarding her own\rbody image and how best to flatter it.  It is not a matter of\r                               -7-\r\r\rnecessity as it would be in the case of tights.  As the court\rnoted in Children's Hose, tights consist of a portion which is\rnot intended to be exposed, which is partially underwear.\rCustoms believes the same cannot be said of the subject garments.\rThey are not partially underwear.  They may be worn as street\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> without a garment to cover the lower torso if the wearer so\rchooses.  Tights, on the other hand, if worn as street <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, must\rbe worn with another garment covering the lower torso.\r\r     Customs has examined advertising material for leggings\rsimilar in appearance to the garments at issue herein.  It is\rinteresting to find that in the Fall & Winter 1990 J.C. Penney\rCatalog, garments which are similar in appearance to those at\rissue are identified in the catalog as pants.  They are\ridentified as ankle-length pants, capri pants or simply pants.\rIn one instance, a garment is identified as leggings in the\rdescriptive material, yet identified as pants in a photograph of\rthe garment.  Leggings of the type at issue herein are often\radvertised either before, after, or alongside advertisements for\rtights.  But, they are not advertised as tights or to be worn\rnecessarily in the same manner as tights.  Additionally, these\rgarments are not displayed in the manner of tights, folded and\rpackaged, but in the manner of trousers, individually hung on\rhangers.  These garments are separately identified by the fashion\rindustry and the retail industry and this is evident by available\radvertising material and the manner in which the garments are\rdisplayed in stores.\r\r     Customs contacted store buyers regarding leggings and\rtights.  Two of these buyers were cooperative in answering\rquestions regarding leggings and tights.  Of course, the\rinformation provided was based on their personal opinions,\rhowever, we believe it to be informative considering their\rpositions.  Based on those conversations, Customs learned of the\rdifference in the display of leggings from tights.  Each buyer\rviewed tights and leggings as different articles.  One buyer\rstated that leggings are sold in every department of the store;\rthey are not limited to simply one area.  This same buyer\rindicated that tights and leggings are worn differently.\rLeggings may be worn with an oversized sweater, but tights would\rnot be so worn.  The other buyer indicated she would not view\rleggings as pants or tights and that leggings are usually of a\rheavier fabric than tights.  Customs views this information as\rsupportive that tights and leggings, at least the ones at issue\rherein, are distinct articles and thus, differently classified.\r\r     We now return to the garments themselves, for it is the\rgarments on which the classification decision is based.  As\rstated earlier, Customs does not regard the garments at issue\rherein as hosiery.  On the contrary, these garments fall within\ran emerging class of merchandise known commercially as leggings\r                               -8-\r\r\rand worn, in Customs view, principally as trousers by women and\rgirls.  Customs decision that the garments at issue herein are\rnot a form of hosiery, but are trousers, is based upon, not only\rthe manner in which the garments are worn, but also the overall\rappearance of the garments and the knit fabric from which the\rgarments are made.  Customs believes the fabric utilized in\rmanufacturing these garments is not fabric of the kind typically\rused in the manufacture of hosiery articles.  Instead, it is not\runlike knit fabrics commonly used today to make form-fitting\rdresses, skirts and tops.\r\r     Having determined that the garments at issue herein are of a\rclass of garments worn as trousers and commercially known as\rleggings, it is necessary to express caution in interpreting this\rruling.  The term leggings is being used liberally by the fashion\rindustry to identify a range of garments which have in common the\rcharacteristic of being form-fitting.  As with any range, there\rare extremes.  Customs is of the view that that is true of\rleggings.  There are garments currently identified as leggings\rwhich may be classifiable as tights depending on the nature of\rthe garments and whether they fall within the meaning of tights\ras expressed by the court in Children's Hose.\r\r     The garments at issue herein are not of the fringe.  They\rare within what Customs perceives to be the main stream.  They\rare part of the majority of garments identified as leggings and\rworn in the manner of trousers, not tights.  Therefore, the\rsubject garments are classifiable as women's trousers of heading\r6104, HTSUSA.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The garments at issue, styles 503 and 504, are classified as\rwomen's trousers of heading 6104.62.2010, HTSUSA.  Garments\rclassified in this heading are subject to duty at a rate of 16.7\rpercent ad valorem and fall within textile category 348.\r\r     In HRL 088454 of October 11, 1991, Customs Headquarters\rruled on a garment much like styles 503 and 504.  That ruling\rwas the first Headquarters ruling on the classification of\rgarments known as leggings.  Customs acknowledges that there has\rbeen some confusion regarding the classification of these\rgarments.  Much of the concern about the classification, however,\rrevolves around the category designation.\r\r     Category designation is the responsibility of the Committee\rfor the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA).  On\rSeptember 10, 1991, in an effort to clarify the scope of\rcategories 359/659 with regard to tights contained therein, CITA\rissued a directive to the Commissioner of Customs to amend the\r                               -9-\r\r\rdefinition of tights contained in the Guidelines for the\rReporting of Imported Products in Various Textile and Apparel\rCategories, CIE 13/88.  This directive appeared in the September\r16, 1991, issue of the Federal Register.  Pursuant to the\rdirective from CITA, Customs will apply the new guideline\rregarding tights to determine the proper textile category for\rgoods exported to the United States on or after January 1, 1992.\r\r     Due to the apparent confusion regarding the classification\rof leggings, Customs will delay the effective date of this ruling\runtil January 1, 1992.  This action is taken pursuant to 19 CFR\r177.9(3)(1).  In addition, with the agreement of the Commerce\rDepartment and in accordance with the September 10, 1991,\rdirective from CITA, Customs will continue to apply the current\rcategory guideline for tights until the new guideline takes\reffect on January 1, 1992.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, the visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since\rpart categories are the result of international bilateral\ragreements which are subject to frequent renegotiations and\rchanges, to obtain the most current information available, we\rsuggest you check, close to the time of shipment, the Status\rReport On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an internal\rissuance of the U.S. Customs Service which is updated weekly and\ris available for inspection at your local Customs office.\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories, you should contact your local\rCustoms office prior to importation of this merchandise to\rdetermine the current status of any import restraints or\rrequirements.\r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director\r                                   Commercial Rulings Division\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1991/089945.doc"",""id"":5192,""rulingNumber"":""089945"",""subject"":""Classification of two women's knit garments for the lower    torso and legs; tights, 6115, v. trousers, 6104"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1991-11-12T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""088454""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6104.62.2010""]}"

We have considered the evidence provided and the\rarguments made by the protestant, as well as Customs records\rrelating to this matter.  Our decision follows.\r\rThe samples enclosed with the protest are returned as you\rrequested.\r\rFACTS:\r\rAccording to the file and Customs records, on May 30, 1995, the\rprotestant entered the merchandise under consideration. \rAccording to the entry summary for the merchandise, the\rmerchandise consisted of women's footwear, with a total entered\rvalue of $7,000 and a total entered duty of $756.13.  The\rinvoices for the merchandise bear the notation:\r\r    HTSUS 9811.00.60.  Footwear is marked  samples not for\r    resale' on sole on insole of shoe.  Samples of no commercial\r    value.  Value for Customs purposes only.\r\rFive sample shoes are provided.  In the case of four of the\rsamples, the marking \""SAMPLES NOT FOR RESALE\"" is on the outside\rof the sole of the shoe in letters more than 1/8 inch high,\rlocated at the widest point of the soles (approximately below\rwhere the ball of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> would be).  In the case of two of\rthese shoes, the marking is partially defaced (i.e., the words\r\""not for\"" are scratched over, leaving the words \""samples\"" and\r\""resale\"" unscratched.  In the case of two of these shoes, the\rmarking is a gold color against an off-white, or cream, sole.  In\rthe case of the other two of these shoes, the marking is off-white against a dark brown sole.  In the case of the fifth\rsample, the marking is on the inside of the shoe (or sock\rlining), in the front half of the shoe with the marking being in\ra gold color against an off-white, or cream, color.\r\rThe entry was liquidated as entered on September 15, 1995.  By\rletter of January 17, 1996 (received by Customs January 24,\r1996), a Customs broker, stating it represented the protestant,\r\""protest[ed] the liquidation of the [entry under consideration]\ras a clerical error under sec[.] 520.c.1 as our entry clerk\rclearly made a mistake of fact\"".  The broker went on to state:\r\r    This shipment was processed as a duty paid entry when in\r    fact all the merchandise was clearly marked \""Samples not for\r    resale\"" as is indicated on all the invoice[s] in the entry\r    package.\r\rBy letter of July 1, 1996, Customs denied the request in the\rJanuary 17, 1996, letter on the following basis:\r\r    Please be advised, both the samples and U.S. Customs\r    original decision were reviewed [and] determined that\r    Customs original decision was found to be correct.\r\rOn January 31, 1996, the protestant filed the protest under\rconsideration.  The stated basis for the protest was:\r\r    The [a]bove decision [July 1, 1996, letter from Customs\r    denying the request for reliquidation under 19 U.S.C.\r    1520(c)(1)] is inconsistent with Ruling No. 556529, which\r    allowed the marking of \""Sample not for Resale\"" on the shoe.\""\r\rFurther review was requested, citing ruling 556529, and granted.\r\rISSUE:\r\rMay relief be granted under 19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1) in this protest?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rInitially, we note that both the request for reliquidation under\r19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1) and the protest of the denial of that\rrequest, under 19 U.S.C. 1514(a), were timely filed, and that the\rdenial of a request for reliquidation under section 1520(c)(1) is\ra protestable decision under section 1514 (19 U.S.C. 1514(a)(7)).\r\rUnder 19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1), Customs may reliquidate an entry to\rcorrect a clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence,\rnot amounting to an error in the construction of a law and\radverse to the importer, when certain conditions are met. \rSection 1520(c)(1) has frequently been interpreted by the Courts. \rIt has been stated that \""[a] clerical error is a mistake made by\ra clerk or other subordinate, upon whom devolves no duty to\rexercise judgement, in writing or copying the figures or in\rexercising his intention\"" (see PPG Industries, Inc., v. United\rStates, 7 CIT 118, 124 (1984), and cases cited therein).  It has\rbeen stated that: \""[M]istakes of fact occur in instances where\reither (1) the facts exist, but are unknown, or (2) the facts do\rnot exist as they are believed to [and] [m]istakes of law, on the\rother hand, occur where the facts are known, but their legal\rconsequences are not known or are believed to be different than\rthey really are\"" (Executone Information Systems v. United States,\r96 F. 3d 1383, 1386 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (emphasis in original),\rciting Hambro Automotive Corporation v. United States, 66 CCPA\r113, 118, C.A.D. 1231, 603 F. 2d 850 (1979); see also, Degussa\rCanada Ltd. v. United States, 87 F. 3d 1301 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). \rInadvertence has been defined as \""an oversight or involuntary\raccident, or the result of inattention or carelessness, and even\ras a type of mistake\"" (Aviall of Texas, Inc. v. United States, 70\rF. 3d 1248, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1995), citing Hambro, supra).\r\rThe conditions required to be met under 19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1) are\rthat the clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence\rmust be adverse to the importer, manifest from the record or\restablished by documentary evidence, and brought to the attention\rof Customs within one year after the date of liquidation of the\rentry.  The relief provided for in 19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1) is not an\ralternative to the relief provided for in the form of protests\runder 19 U.S.C. 1514; section 1520(c)(1) only affords \""limited\rrelief in the situations defined therein\"" (Phillips Petroleum\rCompany v. United States, 54 CCPA 7, 11, C.A.D. 893 (1966),\rquoted in Godchaux-Henderson Sugar Co., Inc., v. United States,\r85 Cust. Ct. 68, 69, C.D. 4874, 496 F. Supp. 1326 (1980); see\ralso, Computime, Inc. v. United States, 9 CIT 553, 555, 622 F.\rSupp. 1083 (1985) (cited by the protestant, see above), and\rConcentric Pumps, Ltd. v. United States, 10 CIT 505, 508, 643 F.\rSupp. 623 (1986)).\r\rBasically, the protestant in this case claims that the entries\rshould have been reliquidated because the \""entry clerk\"" of the\rbroker of the protestant \""clearly made a mistake of fact\"", in\rthat \""... all the merchandise was clearly marked  Samples not for\rresale' as is indicated on all the invoice[s] in the entry\rpackage.\""  No evidence of the alleged mistake of fact is\rprovided.\r\rIt is fundamental that in order to qualify for relief under 19\rU.S.C. 1520(c)(1), it must be established that there was an error\ror mistake (i.e., in this case, it must be established that the\rentry and liquidation were incorrect).\r\rThe ruling cited by the protestant (HQ 556529) holds that \""[t]he\rmarking of non-quota footwear imported for sample use by means of\ra label reading  Sample Not For Resale' permanently attached to\rthe sock lining in a readily visible place may qualify for free\rentry under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS [and] where the sock\rlining will not be visible, the stamping of the sample legend\ronto the outer sole with indelible ink would suffice to qualify\rthe shoes for duty-free entry under this subheading, provided the\rink cannot be removed without disfiguring the sole.\""  In the LAW\rAND ANALYSIS of the ruling it is stated that \""[t]his [i.e., the\rabove-quoted holding] assumes that the ink cannot be removed\rwithout disfiguring the soles, and that the legend is stamped on\rthe sole in close proximity to the heel so that the ink will not\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> off.\""  See also, rulings HQ 555552, HQ 557825, and HQ\r560231.  In ruling HQ 557825, we held:\r\r    The footwear imported for sample use which has the marking\r    \""Sample Not For Resale\"" embossed on the sole of the shoe in\r    a readily visible place may qualify for free entry into the\r    U.S. under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS, provided that the\r    legend cannot be removed without disfiguring the soles of\r    the shoe and the legend is stamped on the sole in close\r    proximity to the heel so that the ink will not likely <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>\r    off.\r\rIn the case of the samples provided in this case, four of the\rfive samples have the marking not in close proximity to the heel,\rbut right below the ball of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> where \""... the ink will ...\rlikely <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> off\"" (quoted from above, with emphasis added), and in\rtwo of those samples, the defacement of the marking indicates how\rreadily the marking may <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> off.  In the case of three of the\rsamples, the color of the marking is not clearly contrasting\r(gold on off-white or cream) (note that ruling HQ 556529 refers\rto a marking in \""indelible dark ink\"" and ruling HQ 557825 refers\rto \""a visible legend ... in a contrasting color\"".  In the case of\rthe sample in which the marking is not on the sole but on the\rinside of the shoe (or sock lining), although the shoe is open on\rpart of the sides, the marking is on the front part of the shoe,\rpartially below the closed toe-portion and may not be \""readily\rvisible\"" (see ruling HQ 555552) or \""conspicuous\"" (see ruling HQ\r557825).  We note, in this regard, that, for the reasons given\rabove, the Customs field office advised that the protest should\rbe denied on the merits (see ruling HQ 555552, which contains the\rproviso that the appropriate Customs officer \""[must be] satisfied\rthat such treatment [marking] renders the shoes unsuitable for\ruse for any purpose other than soliciting orders for foreign\rmerchandise\"").\r\rEven if we were to assume that the entry and liquidation were\rincorrect in this case, the protestant must also establish that\rthe alleged error was due to clerical error, mistake of fact, or\rother inadvertence, not amounting to an error in the construction\rof a law, adverse to the importer and manifest from the record or\restablished by documentary evidence.  In this case, the\rprotestant claims that the alleged error was due to a mistake of\rfact, (i.e., \""... where either (1) the facts exist, but are\runknown, or (2) the facts do not exist as they are believed to\r...\"" (Executone, supra); see also, ITT Corp. v. United States,\r812 F. Supp. 213 (CIT 1993), reversed, 24 F. 3rd 1384 (Fed. Cir.\r1994) (\""... the document preparer simply understood the nature of\rthe merchandise to be other than what it was [and] [t]hus, a\rmistake of fact occurred\"" (812 F. Supp. at 216); although the\rCourt of Appeals reversed, it stated about the CIT finding of a\rmistake of fact: \""[the finding] is amply supported by the record\rand not clearly erroneous\"" (24 F. 3d at 1388))).\r\rUnder 19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1), the clerical error, mistake of fact,\ror other inadvertence not amounting to an error in the\rconstruction of a law must be \""manifest from the record or\restablished by documentary evidence.\""  The alleged error in this\rcase is not manifest from the record (see ITT, 24 F. 3d at 1387,\r\""... manifest from the record [means] apparent to Customs from a\rfacial examination of the entry and the entry papers alone, and\rthus requir[ing] no further substantiation\"").  In ITT, the Court\rstated that \""[m]istakes of fact that are not manifest from [the]\rrecord ... must be established by documentary evidence\"" (id.).\r\rIn this case there is no such documentary evidence and there is\rno explanation (other than the statement that \""our entry clerk\rclearly made a mistake of fact\"") as to how or why the alleged\rerror occurred.  However, there is documentary evidence that the\rimporter and broker knew, or should have known the nature of the\rmerchandise under consideration (i.e., each of the invoices for\rthe merchandise includes a statement that the footwear consists\rof \""samples of no commercial value\"" and is marked \""Samples Not\rFor Resale\"" and each invoice bears the classification notation\r\""HTSUS 9811.00.60\"").  In such a case, the Court of International\rTrade has held that relief under 19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1) is not\ravailable (see B.S. Livingston & Co. v. United States, 13 CIT 889\r(1989)).  In the Livingston case, the Court stated:\r\r    In this case, plaintiff has not claimed, and, indeed, cannot\r    state that it was unaware or mistaken as to any facts\r    pertaining to the merchandise [because the merchandise was\r    correctly described in the invoice and the asserted\r    classification was provided in the invoice].  Hence, in this\r    action plaintiff can only state that it \""carelessly placed\r    the incorrect tariff classification on the entry documents.\r\r    ...\r\r    Upon the record before the court, it is the determination of\r    the court that plaintiff has not stated a claim upon which\r    relief may be granted pursuant to section 1520(c)(1). [13\r    CIT at 894]\r\rFurther, if the protestant intended to allege that the allegedly\rincorrect entry and liquidation was due to a clerical error, we\rnote that the Courts have held that the essence of clerical error\ris the intent of the person preparing the document in which the\rerror was allegedly made and where there is no evidence from that\rperson as to his or her intent, the evidence is insufficient to\rsustain a claim of clerical error (see, e.g., Pacific Trading Co.\rv. United States, 20 Cust. Ct. 170, C.D. 1103 (1948); Francisco\rCastelazo v. United States, 24 Cust. Ct. 294, C.D. 1250 (1950);\rsee also PPG Industries, Inc. v. United States, 7 CIT 118\r(1984)).\r\rAccordingly, we have no choice but to DENY the protest under\rconsideration.\r\rHOLDING:\r\rRelief may NOT be granted under 19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1) for the\rreasons given in the LAW AND ANALYSIS portion of this ruling. \rThe protest is DENIED.\r\rIn accordance with Section 3A(11)(b) of Customs Directive 099\r3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject:  Revised Protest\rDirective, this decision should be mailed by your office, with\rthe Customs Form 19, to the protestant no later than 60 days from\rthe date of this letter.

The garment is designed to cover the lower torso\rand legs from the waist to the ankles.  It features a one-inch\relasticized self-fabric waistband, a gusset in the crotch, seams\ralong the inside of the legs and hemmed leg openings.  There is\rno indication as to the size of the garment.  We will assume the\rgarment is intended to be form-fitting\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Is style 715 classifiable as women's trousers of heading\r6104, HTSUSA, or as tights of heading 6115, HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, provided such\rheadings or notes do not otherwise require, according to [the\rremaining GRIs taken in order].\""\r\r                               -2-\r\r\r     The garment at issue is similar to garments known\rcommercially as leggings and previously ruled upon by Customs.\rSee, HRL 088454 of October 11, 1991.  Leggings are relatively new\rcreations of the fashion industry, as is the use of the term\r\""leggings\"" to describe them.  The term \""leggings\"" by which they\rare known commercially was not in wide-spread use when the\rcurrent tariff was adopted.  However, the tariff does contain a\rprovision which includes leggings, i.e., heading 6406, HTSUSA,\rwhich provides for, inter alia, gaiters, leggings and similar\rarticles.  The garments at issue herein are not the leggings\rwhich are classifiable in heading 6406, HTSUSA.  [For further\rdiscussion see, HRL 088454].\r\r     In determining the proper classification of the garment at\rissue, two headings clearly merit consideration.  These are\rheading 6104, HTSUSA, which provides for, inter alia, trousers,\rbreeches and shorts, and heading 6115, HTSUSA, which provides\rfor, inter alia, tights.\r\r     It is a well-established tenet of customs law that tariff\rterms are construed in accordance with their common and\rcommercial meanings and that the common meaning of a tariff term\ris a question of law.  Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. United\rStates, 7 CIT 178, 182, 585 F. Supp. 649 (1984), aff'd, 753 F.2d\r1061 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\r\r     The HTSUSA and the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized\rSystem are silent on the meaning of the term tights.  However,\rtrousers are defined in the Explanatory Notes as:\r\r     garments which envelop each leg separately, covering the\r     knees and usually reaching down to or below the ankles;\r     these garments usually stop at the waist; the presence of\r     braces does not cause these garments to lose the essential\r     character of trousers.\r\r     Heading 6115, HTSUSA, provides, in full, for panty hose,\rtights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings\rfor varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted\ror crocheted.  As the tariff is silent regarding the meaning of\rtights, it is reasonable and proper to look to lexicographic\rsources.  The statutory canon of construction \""noscitur a sociis\""\ris useful in determining the common and commercial meaning of the\rterm tights.  Accordingly, Customs has researched various\rlexicographic sources to discern the common meaning of trousers\rand of tights, hose and hosiery.

We do not believe the garments at issue herein,\rrepresented by the submitted sample, are a form of hosiery.  In\rMast Industries v. United States, 9 CIT 549, 552 (1985), aff'd,\r786 F. 2d 1144 (1986), the court noted, citing United States v.\rBruce Duncan Co., 50 CCPA 43, 46, C.A.D. 817 (1963), \""the\rmerchandise itself may be strong evidence of use.\""  The sample\rgarment is form-fitting and covers the lower torso and legs,\rhowever, upon examination Customs believes it to be more in the\rnature of trousers, than hosiery.  The above-cited definitions of\rtrousers indicate that they are garments which cover the lower\rtorso from the waist to the ankle or, sometimes, simply to the\rknee, and cover each leg separately.  At least one definition\rabove illustrates that trousers may be close-fitting depending on\rthe fashion.  Additionally, Customs notes that although the cited\rdefinitions refer to trousers as garments worn especially by men\ror boys, women too <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> trousers.  Therefore, it would appear\rthat the garments at issue are within the definition of trousers,\rincluding the definition contained in the Explanatory Notes of\rthe Harmonized System.\r\r     The meaning of the term tights was examined by the Customs\rCourt in Children's Hose Inc., v. United States, 55 Cust. Ct. 6,\rC.D. 2547 (1965).  In that case, the court stated:\r\r     [T]he court may take judicial notice of the fact that\r     leotards or tights whether worn by children or women are\r     designed to be at least partially utilized under an\r     outergarment and partially exposed, depending upon the age\r     of the wearer and the purpose for which they are worn.  It\r     would, therefore, seem that if a portion of this imported\r     merchandise is underwear, a portion of it is not underwear.\r     By the same token, while the exposed portion may be\r     outerwear, the portion concealed would not be outerwear.\r     Therefore, the articles at bar are more than underwear and\r     more than outerwear.  They are, therefore, in fact \""neither\r     fish nor fowl.\""  (at 9 and 10)\r\rIt is clear from the language of the court, that tights are\rgarments which are partially underwear and partially outerwear.\rThe extent to which the garment is exposed to view is dependent\rupon the age of the wearer and the purpose for which the garment\ris worn.  This interpretation would follow some of the previously\rcited definitions for tights which describe them as knitted pants\rand stockings in one piece or underpants and stockings knit in\rone piece.\r\r                               -6-\r\r\r     In United States v. Great Pacific Co., Shui Tai & Co., 23\rCCPA 319, 324, T.D. 48192, the court stated:\r\r     A common meaning, having been once established and\r     determined by a court, will be presumed to continue until\r     the language is changed by subsequent legislation.\r\rHowever, the tariff schedules in force at the time of Children's\rHose did not have a provision for tights as the current tariff\rdoes, nor did it have a provision for trousers.  Therefore, while\rthe determination of the court regarding the meaning of the term\rtights and the manner in which they are designed to be worn is\rinstructive in this case, it is not determinative because the\rterm tights was not part of the statutory language of the tariff\rat the time of Children's Hose.  The meaning of an eo nomine\rclassification is determined as of the time of the enactment of\rthe tariff provision.  FAG Bearings, Ltd. v. United States, 9 CIT\r227, 228 (1985)  In this case, the HTSUSA (of which heading 6115\rwhich provides for tights is part) was enacted as part of the\rOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, P.L. 100-418,\rTitle I, sec. 1201, 102 Stat. 1147 (1988), and became effective\ron January 1, 1989.  Nonetheless, Customs does not believe the\rcommon meaning of the term tights changed much between 1965 and\r1989.\r\r     In deciding if the subject garment is within the eo nomine\rclassification for tights, Customs may consider the use of the\rmerchandise.  United States v. Quon Quon Co., 46 CCPA 70, 73,\rC.A.D. 699 (1959).  Customs interprets the use of the merchandise\rto include the manner in which it is worn as well as the reasons\rfor which it is worn.\r\r     Customs recognizes that the garment at issue herein belongs\rto a class of garments known commercially as leggings.  These\rgarments are generally worn in conjunction with a garment which\rjust barely covers the lower torso, i.e., reaches just below the\rhip area.  Consequently, the portion of the leggings which covers\rthe lower torso is exposed to view as the wearer reaches or bends\ror moves about in the course of normal activity.  Additionally,\rthese garments are not always worn with a garment which covers\rthe lower torso.  They may be worn without such a garment\raccording to the discretion of the wearer.  Customs believes the\rdonning of another garment to cover the lower torso when wearing\rleggings such as the garments at issue is a function of fashion\rand the personal perception of the individual regarding her own\rbody image and how best to flatter it.  It is not a matter of\rnecessity as it would be in the case of tights.  As the court\rnoted in Children's Hose, tights consist of a portion which is\rnot intended to be exposed, which is partially underwear.\rCustoms believes the same cannot be said of the subject garments.\rThey are not partially underwear.  They may be worn as street\r                               -7-\r\r\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> without a garment to cover the lower torso if the wearer so\rchooses.  Tights, on the other hand, if worn as street <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, must\rbe worn with another garment covering the lower torso.\r\r     Customs has examined advertising material for leggings\rsimilar in appearance to the garment at issue herein.  It is\rinteresting to find that in the Fall & Winter 1990 J.C. Penney\rCatalog, garments which are similar in appearance to those at\rissue are identified in the catalog as pants.  They are\ridentified as ankle-length pants, capri pants or simply pants.\rIn one instance, a garment is identified as leggings in the\rdescriptive material, yet identified as pants in a photograph of\rthe garment.  Leggings of the type at issue herein are often\radvertised either before, after, or alongside advertisements for\rtights.  But, they are not advertised as tights or to be worn\rnecessarily in the same manner as tights.  Additionally, these\rgarments are not displayed in the manner of tights, folded and\rpackaged, but in the manner of trousers, individually hung on\rhangers.  These garments are separately identified by the fashion\rindustry and the retail industry and this is evident by available\radvertising material and the manner in which the garments are\rdisplayed in stores.\r\r     Customs contacted store buyers regarding leggings and\rtights.  Two of these buyers were cooperative in answering\rquestions regarding leggings and tights.  Of course, the\rinformation provided was based on their personal opinions,\rhowever, we believe it to be informative considering their\rpositions.  Based on those conversations, Customs learned of the\rdifference in the display of leggings from tights.  Each buyer\rviewed tights and leggings as different articles.  One buyer\rstated that leggings are sold in every department of the store;\rthey are not limited to simply one area.  This same buyer\rindicated that tights and leggings are worn differently.\rLeggings may be worn with an oversized sweater, but tights would\rnot be so worn.  The other buyer indicated she would not view\rleggings as pants or tights and that leggings are usually of a\rheavier fabric than tights.  Customs views this information as\rsupportive that tights and leggings, at least the ones at issue\rherein, are distinct articles and thus, differently classified.\r\r     We now return to the garment itself, for it is the garment\ron which the classification decision is based.  As stated\rearlier, Customs does not regard the garment at issue herein as\rhosiery.  On the contrary, this garment falls within an emerging\rclass of merchandise known commercially as leggings and worn, in\rCustoms view, principally as trousers by women and girls.\rCustoms decision that the garment at issue herein is not a form\rof hosiery, but is a pair of trousers, is based upon, not only\rthe manner in which the garment is worn, but also the overall\rappearance of the garment and the knit fabric from which the\r                               -8-\r\r\rgarment is made.  Customs believes the fabric utilized in\rmanufacturing this garment is not fabric of the kind typically\rused in the manufacture of hosiery articles.  Instead, it is not\runlike knit fabrics commonly used today to make form-fitting\rdresses, skirts and tops.\r\r     Having determined that the garment at issue herein is of a\rclass of garments worn as trousers and commercially known as\rleggings, it is necessary to express caution in interpreting this\rruling.  The term leggings is being used liberally by the fashion\rindustry to identify a range of garments which have in common the\rcharacteristic of being form-fitting.  As with any range, there\rare extremes.  Customs is of the view that that is true of\rleggings.  There are garments currently identified as leggings\rwhich may be classifiable as tights depending on the nature of\rthe garments and whether they fall within the meaning of tights\ras expressed by the court in Children's Hose.\r\r     The garment at issue herein is not of the fringe.  It is\rwithin what Customs perceives to be the main stream.  It is part\rof the majority of garments identified as leggings and worn in\rthe manner of trousers, not tights.  Therefore, the subject\rgarments are classifiable as women's trousers of heading 6104,\rHTSUSA.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The garment at issue, style 715, is classified as a pair of\rwomen's trousers of heading 6104.69.2030, HTSUSA.  Garments\rclassified in this heading are subject to duty at a rate of 30\rpercent ad valorem and fall within textile category 648.\r\r     In HRL 088454 of October 11, 1991, Customs Headquarters\rruled on a garment much like style 715.  That ruling was the\rfirst Headquarters ruling on the classification of garments known\ras leggings.  Customs acknowledges that there has been some\rconfusion regarding the classification of these garments.  Much\rof the concern about the classification, however, revolves around\rthe category designation.\r\r     Category designation is the responsibility of the Committee\rfor the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA).  On\rSeptember 10, 1991, in an effort to clarify the scope of\rcategories 359/659 with regard to tights contained therein, CITA\rissued a directive to the Commissioner of Customs to amend the\rdefinition of tights contained in the Guidelines for the\rReporting of Imported Products in Various Textile and Apparel\rCategories, CIE 13/88.  This directive appeared in the September\r16, 1991, issue of the Federal Register.  Pursuant to the\r                               -9-\r\r\rdirective from CITA, Customs will apply the new guideline\rregarding tights to determine the proper textile category for\rgoods exported to the United States on or after January 1, 1992.\r\r     Due to the apparent confusion regarding the classification\rof leggings, Customs will delay the effective date of this ruling\runtil January 1, 1992.  This action is taken pursuant to 19 CFR\r177.9(3)(1).  In addition, with the agreement of the Commerce\rDepartment and in accordance with the September 10, 1991,\rdirective from CITA, Customs will continue to apply the current\rcategory guideline for tights until the new guideline takes\reffect on January 1, 1992.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, the visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since\rpart categories are the result of international bilateral\ragreements which are subject to frequent renegotiations and\rchanges, to obtain the most current information available, we\rsuggest you check, close to the time of shipment, the Status\rReport On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an internal\rissuance of the U.S. Customs Service which is updated weekly and\ris available for inspection at your local Customs office.\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories, you should contact your local\rCustoms office prior to importation of this merchandise to\rdetermine the current status of any import restraints or\rrequirements.\r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director\r                                   Commercial Rulings Division\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1991/950004.doc"",""id"":5969,""rulingNumber"":""950004"",""subject"":""Classification of a women's fine knit garment for the lowertorso and legs; tights, 6115, HTSUSA, v. trousers, 6104, HTSUSA"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1991-11-12T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""088454""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6104.69.2030""]}"

A sample was received with your\rletter.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The submitted sample, style 5837, is a women's 100 percent\rpolyester, fine knit garment designed to be form-fitting and\rcover the lower torso and legs.  The garment features an\relasticized self-fabric waistband, a diamond-shaped gusset in the\rcrotch and hemmed leg bottoms.\r\r     The garment is manufactured in Taiwan and will be entered at\rJFK International Airport.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Is the submitted garment, style 5837, classifiable as tights\rof heading 6115, HTSUSA, or as trousers of heading 6104, HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\r\r                               -2-\r\r\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, provided such\rheadings or notes do not otherwise require, according to [the\rremaining GRIs taken in order].\""\r\r     The garment at issue is similar to garments known\rcommercially as leggings and previously ruled upon by Customs.\rSee, HRL 088454 of October 11, 1991.  Leggings are relatively new\rcreations of the fashion industry, as is the use of the term\r\""leggings\"" to describe them.  The term \""leggings\"" by which they\rare known commercially was not in wide-spread use when the\rcurrent tariff was adopted.  However, the tariff does contain a\rprovision which includes leggings, i.e., heading 6406, HTSUSA,\rwhich provides for, inter alia, gaiters, leggings and similar\rarticles.  The garments at issue herein are not the leggings\rwhich are classifiable in heading 6406, HTSUSA.  [For further\rdiscussion see, HRL 088454].\r\r     In determining the proper classification of the garment at\rissue, two headings clearly merit consideration.  These are\rheading 6104, HTSUSA, which provides for, inter alia, trousers,\rbreeches and shorts, and heading 6115, HTSUSA, which provides\rfor, inter alia, tights.\r\r     It is a well-established tenet of customs law that tariff\rterms are construed in accordance with their common and\rcommercial meanings and that the common meaning of a tariff term\ris a question of law.  Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. United\rStates, 7 CIT 178, 182, 585 F. Supp. 649 (1984), aff'd, 753 F.2d\r1061 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\r\r     The HTSUSA and the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized\rSystem are silent on the meaning of the term tights.  However,\rtrousers are defined in the Explanatory Notes as:\r\r     garments which envelop each leg separately, covering the\r     knees and usually reaching down to or below the ankles;\r     these garments usually stop at the waist; the presence of\r     braces does not cause these garments to lose the essential\r     character of trousers.\r\r     Heading 6115, HTSUSA, provides, in full, for panty hose,\rtights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings\rfor varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted\ror crocheted.  As the tariff is silent regarding the meaning of\rtights, it is reasonable and proper to look to lexicographic\rsources.  The statutory canon of construction \""noscitur a sociis\""\ris useful in determining the common and commercial meaning of the\rterm tights.  Accordingly, Customs has researched various\rlexicographic sources to discern the common meaning of trousers\rand of tights, hose and hosiery.  The following pertinent\rdefinitions were found.\r                               -3-\r\r\r     TROUSERS\r\r          An outer garment of men or boys, extending from the\r          waist to the knee or, oftener and almost always with\r          men, to the ankle, and covering each leg separately.\r          Orig. they were of the nature of long hose or tight\r          drawers and were worn esp. by sailors and soldiers.\r          Webster's New International Dictionary, Unabridged\r          (2nd Ed., 1939)\r\r          A usually loose-fitting outer garment for the lower\r          part of the body, having individual leg portions that\r          reach typically to the ankle but sometimes to any of\r          various other points from the upper leg down, worn esp.\r          by men and boys.

We do not believe the garments at issue herein,\rrepresented by the submitted sample, are a form of hosiery.  In\rMast Industries v. United States, 9 CIT 549, 552 (1985), aff'd,\r786 F. 2d 1144 (1986), the court noted, citing United States v.\rBruce Duncan Co., 50 CCPA 43, 46, C.A.D. 817 (1963), \""the\rmerchandise itself may be strong evidence of use.\""  The sample\rgarment is form-fitting and covers the lower torso and legs,\rhowever, upon examination Customs believes it to be more in the\rnature of trousers, than hosiery.  The above-cited definitions of\rtrousers indicate that they are garments which cover the lower\rtorso from the waist to the ankle or, sometimes, simply to the\rknee, and cover each leg separately.  At least one definition\rabove illustrates that trousers may be close-fitting depending on\rthe fashion.  Additionally, Customs notes that although the cited\rdefinitions refer to trousers as garments worn especially by men\ror boys, women too <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> trousers.  Therefore, it would appear\rthat the garments at issue are within the definition of trousers,\rincluding the definition contained in the Explanatory Notes of\rthe Harmonized System.\r\r     The meaning of the term tights was examined by the Customs\rCourt in Children's Hose Inc., v. United States, 55 Cust. Ct. 6,\rC.D. 2547 (1965).  In that case, the court stated:\r\r     [T]he court may take judicial notice of the fact that\r     leotards or tights whether worn by children or women are\r     designed to be at least partially utilized under an\r     outergarment and partially exposed, depending upon the age\r     of the wearer and the purpose for which they are worn.  It\r     would, therefore, seem that if a portion of this imported\r     merchandise is underwear, a portion of it is not underwear.\r     By the same token, while the exposed portion may be\r     outerwear, the portion concealed would not be outerwear.\r     Therefore, the articles at bar are more than underwear and\r     more than outerwear.  They are, therefore, in fact \""neither\r     fish nor fowl.\""  (at 9 and 10)\r\rIt is clear from the language of the court, that tights are\rgarments which are partially underwear and partially outerwear.\rThe extent to which the garment is exposed to view is dependent\rupon the age of the wearer and the purpose for which the garment\ris worn.  This interpretation would follow some of the previously\rcited definitions for tights which describe them as knitted pants\rand stockings in one piece or underpants and stockings knit in\rone piece.\r\r                               -6-\r\r\r     In United States v. Great Pacific Co., Shui Tai & Co., 23\rCCPA 319, 324, T.D. 48192, the court stated:\r\r     A common meaning, having been once established and\r     determined by a court, will be presumed to continue until\r     the language is changed by subsequent legislation.\r\rHowever, the tariff schedules in force at the time of Children's\rHose did not have a provision for tights as the current tariff\rdoes, nor did it have a provision for trousers.  Therefore, while\rthe determination of the court regarding the meaning of the term\rtights and the manner in which they are designed to be worn is\rinstructive in this case, it is not determinative because the\rterm tights was not part of the statutory language of the tariff\rat the time of Children's Hose.  The meaning of an eo nomine\rclassification is determined as of the time of the enactment of\rthe tariff provision.  FAG Bearings, Ltd. v. United States, 9 CIT\r227, 228 (1985)  In this case, the HTSUSA (of which heading 6115\rwhich provides for tights is part) was enacted as part of the\rOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, P.L. 100-418,\rTitle I, sec. 1201, 102 Stat. 1147 (1988), and became effective\ron January 1, 1989.  Nonetheless, Customs does not believe the\rcommon meaning of the term tights changed much between 1965 and\r1989.\r\r     In deciding if the subject garment is within the eo nomine\rclassification for tights, Customs may consider the use of the\rmerchandise.  United States v. Quon Quon Co., 46 CCPA 70, 73,\rC.A.D. 699 (1959).  Customs interprets the use of the merchandise\rto include the manner in which it is worn as well as the reasons\rfor which it is worn.\r\r     Customs recognizes that the garment at issue herein belongs\rto a class of garments known commercially as leggings.  These\rgarments are generally worn in conjunction with a garment which\rjust barely covers the lower torso, i.e., reaches just below the\rhip area.  Consequently, the portion of the leggings which covers\rthe lower torso is exposed to view as the wearer reaches or bends\ror moves about in the course of normal activity.  Additionally,\rthese garments are not always worn with a garment which covers\rthe lower torso.  They may be worn without such a garment\raccording to the discretion of the wearer.  Customs believes the\rdonning of another garment to cover the lower torso when wearing\rleggings such as the garments at issue is a function of fashion\rand the personal perception of the individual regarding her own\rbody image and how best to flatter it.  It is not a matter of\rnecessity as it would be in the case of tights.  As the court\rnoted in Children's Hose, tights consist of a portion which is\rnot intended to be exposed, which is partially underwear.\rCustoms believes the same cannot be said of the subject garments.\rThey are not partially underwear.  They may be worn as street\r                               -7-\r\r\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> without a garment to cover the lower torso if the wearer so\rchooses.  Tights, on the other hand, if worn as street <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, must\rbe worn with another garment covering the lower torso.\r\r     Customs has examined advertising material for leggings\rsimilar in appearance to the garment at issue herein.  It is\rinteresting to find that in the Fall & Winter 1990 J.C. Penney\rCatalog, garments which are similar in appearance to those at\rissue are identified in the catalog as pants.  They are\ridentified as ankle-length pants, capri pants or simply pants.\rIn one instance, a garment is identified as leggings in the\rdescriptive material, yet identified as pants in a photograph of\rthe garment.  Leggings of the type at issue herein are often\radvertised either before, after, or alongside advertisements for\rtights.  But, they are not advertised as tights or to be worn\rnecessarily in the same manner as tights.  Additionally, these\rgarments are not displayed in the manner of tights, folded and\rpackaged, but in the manner of trousers, individually hung on\rhangers.  These garments are separately identified by the fashion\rindustry and the retail industry and this is evident by available\radvertising material and the manner in which the garments are\rdisplayed in stores.\r\r     Customs contacted store buyers regarding leggings and\rtights.  Two of these buyers were cooperative in answering\rquestions regarding leggings and tights.  Of course, the\rinformation provided was based on their personal opinions,\rhowever, we believe it to be informative considering their\rpositions.  Based on those conversations, Customs learned of the\rdifference in the display of leggings from tights.  Each buyer\rviewed tights and leggings as different articles.  One buyer\rstated that leggings are sold in every department of the store;\rthey are not limited to simply one area.  This same buyer\rindicated that tights and leggings are worn differently.\rLeggings may be worn with an oversized sweater, but tights would\rnot be so worn.  The other buyer indicated she would not view\rleggings as pants or tights and that leggings are usually of a\rheavier fabric than tights.  Customs views this information as\rsupportive that tights and leggings, at least the ones at issue\rherein, are distinct articles and thus, differently classified.\r\r     We now return to the garment itself, for it is the garment\ron which the classification decision is based.  As stated\rearlier, Customs does not regard the garment at issue herein as\rhosiery.  On the contrary, this garment falls within an emerging\rclass of merchandise known commercially as leggings and worn, in\rCustoms view, principally as trousers by women and girls.\rCustoms decision that the garment at issue herein is not a form\rof hosiery, but is a pair of trousers, is based upon, not only\rthe manner in which the garment is worn, but also the overall\rappearance of the garment and the knit fabric from which the\r                               -8-\r\r\rgarment is made.  Customs believes the fabric utilized in\rmanufacturing this garment is not fabric of the kind typically\rused in the manufacture of hosiery articles.  Instead, it is not\runlike knit fabrics commonly used today to make form-fitting\rdresses, skirts and tops.\r\r     Having determined that the garment at issue herein is of a\rclass of garments worn as trousers and commercially known as\rleggings, it is necessary to express caution in interpreting this\rruling.  The term leggings is being used liberally by the fashion\rindustry to identify a range of garments which have in common the\rcharacteristic of being form-fitting.  As with any range, there\rare extremes.  Customs is of the view that that is true of\rleggings.  There are garments currently identified as leggings\rwhich may be classifiable as tights depending on the nature of\rthe garments and whether they fall within the meaning of tights\ras expressed by the court in Children's Hose.\r\r     The garment at issue herein is not of the fringe.  It is\rwithin what Customs perceives to be the main stream.  It is part\rof the majority of garments identified as leggings and worn in\rthe manner of trousers, not tights.  Therefore, the subject\rgarments are classifiable as women's trousers of heading 6104,\rHTSUSA.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The garment at issue, style 5837, is classified as women's\rtrousers of heading 6104.63.2010, HTSUSA.  Garments classified in\rthis heading are subject to duty at a rate of 30 percent ad\rvalorem and fall within textile category 648.\r\r     In HRL 088454 of October 11, 1991, Customs Headquarters\rruled on a garment much like style 715.  That ruling was the\rfirst Headquarters ruling on the classification of garments known\ras leggings.  Customs acknowledges that there has been some\rconfusion regarding the classification of these garments.  Much\rof the concern about the classification, however, revolves around\rthe category designation.\r\r     Category designation is the responsibility of the Committee\rfor the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA).  On\rSeptember 10, 1991, in an effort to clarify the scope of\rcategories 359/659 with regard to tights contained therein, CITA\rissued a directive to the Commissioner of Customs to amend the\rdefinition of tights contained in the Guidelines for the\rReporting of Imported Products in Various Textile and Apparel\rCategories, CIE 13/88.  This directive appeared in the September\r16, 1991, issue of the Federal Register.  Pursuant to the\r                               -9-\r\r\rdirective from CITA, Customs will apply the new guideline\rregarding tights to determine the proper textile category for\rgoods exported to the United States on or after January 1, 1992.\r\r     Due to the apparent confusion regarding the classification\rof leggings, Customs will delay the effective date of this ruling\runtil January 1, 1992.  This action is taken pursuant to 19 CFR\r177.9(3)(1).  In addition, with the agreement of the Commerce\rDepartment and in accordance with the September 10, 1991,\rdirective from CITA, Customs will continue to apply the current\rcategory guideline for tights until the new guideline takes\reffect on January 1, 1992.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, the visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since\rpart categories are the result of international bilateral\ragreements which are subject to frequent renegotiations and\rchanges, to obtain the most current information available, we\rsuggest you check, close to the time of shipment, the Status\rReport On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an internal\rissuance of the U.S. Customs Service which is updated weekly and\ris available for inspection at your local Customs office.\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories, you should contact your local\rCustoms office prior to importation of this merchandise to\rdetermine the current status of any import restraints or\rrequirements.\r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director\r                                   Commercial Rulings Division\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1991/089997.doc"",""id"":5219,""rulingNumber"":""089997"",""subject"":""Classification of women's knit garment for the lower torso    and legs; tights, 6115, HTSUSA, v. trousers, 6104, HTSUSA"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1991-11-14T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""088454""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6104.63.2010""]}"

No single heading provides for both the sleeper and the\r             booties.

A sample was submitted to this office for review.\r\rFACTS:\r\r\tOn August 25, 1999, our New York office issued to you New York Ruling Letter (NY) E84196, which addressed the classification of a “Hello Kitty” Princess top, skirt, tutu, gloves and slippers from Hong Kong.  Although that ruling reached a classification determination for the top,  skirt, tutu and gloves, the classification for the slippers was not given, and was instead sent to our office for review.  As such, this letter will only discuss the classification of the slippers.\r\r\tThe merchandise at issue, referred to as “Hello Kitty” Princess Ballet Slippers, are comprised of a 100 percent polyester knit fabric upper with 100 percent polyester terry lining and 100 percent vinyl soles.  The slippers feature decorative glued on marabou feathers and plastic “Hello Kitty” face.  Although your letter states that the slippers tie at the top with ribbon of 100 percent woven nylon bearing the words “Hello Kitty”, the sample provided does not have tie ribbons on top.  Instead, a narrow ribbon is glued in at the top which bears no writing.  The slippers are held on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by an elastic band sewn in along the top opening.\r\r\tWe note that although the various “Hello Kitty” samples which were the subject of NY E84196 were manufactured in Hong Kong, the slippers we have received for our review are marked “Made in Taiwan.”\r\r\tIn your submission you state that:\r\rEach of the above stated costume components includes a care tag stating that the article is “For Play Use Only.”  These tags also instruct that in order to properly care for the articles, “Do Not Wash or Dry Clean.”  The tags also state that the costume components are only sold in one size.  Each article includes a header board advertising their fantasy play purpose (i.e. “Live in a big magical castle in the sky”).\r\r\tIt is your opinion that the subject merchandise is “used in the same manner as other festive articles: for occasional fantasy play, and/or for festive occasions such as Halloween.”  As such, you conclude that the subject slippers are appropriately classified as “festive entertainment articles”, in chapter 95, HTSUS.\r\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhat is the appropriate classification for the subject merchandise?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tClassification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 requires that classification be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes, taken in order.  Where goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, the remaining GRI will be applied, in the order of their appearance.\r\r\tThere are two plausible classifications for the subject merchandise.  Heading 9505, HTSUS, which provides for, among other things, festive, carnival or other entertainment articles, and heading 6404, HTSUS, which provides for, among other things, footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics.\r\r\t\tIn Midwest of Cannon Falls, Inc. v. United States, Court No. \r92-03-00206, 1996 Ct. Int'l Trade LEXIS 15 (Ct. Int'l. Trade, January 18, 1996), and 122 F.3d 1423 (Fed.Cir. 1997) (hereinafter Midwest), the Court addressed the scope of heading 9505, HTSUS, specifically, the class or kind \""festive articles.\"" It then applied its conclusions to 29 specific articles to determine whether they were included within the scope of the class \""festive articles.\"" This application provided new guidelines for the classification of \""festive articles.\"" In\rgeneral, merchandise is classifiable in heading 9505, HTSUS, as a \""festive\rarticle\"" when the article, as a whole:\r\r   1. Is not predominately of precious or semiprecious stones, precious metal or\r      metal clad with precious metal;\r\r   2. Functions primarily as a decoration or functional item used in celebration\r       of and for entertainment on a holiday; and\r\r   3. Is associated with or used on a particular holiday.\r\rThe Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (EN) to heading 9505, state, in pertinent part:\r\rThis heading covers:\r\r   (A) Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles, which in view of their\r        intended use are generally made of non-durable material. They include:\r\r\t\t\t\t\t\t*    *    *    \r\r   \t(3) Articles of fancy dress, e.g., masks, false ears and noses, wigs, false\rbeards and moustaches (not being articles of postiche - heading                      67.04), and paper hats. However, the heading excludes fancy dress of textile materials, of Chapter 61 or 62.\r\r   \t\t\t\t\t*    *    *    \r\r\t\tAs we stated in HQ 087336, dated August 28, 1990, classifying certain “Disney Mickey Footlights Slippers”:\r\r….We consider  toy footwear  in Chapter 95, HTSUSA, to be doll's shoes, dress up shoes and items which would not be useful or saleable if the amusing and playful additions were not present. The Disney Mickey Footlights are not doll or dress up shoes and are usable and saleable\rwithout the figure of Mickey Mouse and the headlights.   \r\rFurthermore, the instant merchandise is not chiefly used for the amusement of children or adults and any amusement derived from the Mickey Mouse configuration is incidental to the product's primary function, which is to serve as footwear. The Disney Footlights are functional slippers with a toy design feature. As a result, the Disney Mickey Footlights are not classifiable in Chapter 95, HTSUSA, and are properly classifiable as footwear in Chapter 64, HTSUSA.\r\r\r\r\r\r\t\tSimilarly, in the case of the subject merchandise, we find no evidence supporting the claim that the slippers at issue are to be solely used in celebration of and for entertainment on a holiday, or that any functional footwear is a symbol of, associated with or used on a particular recognized holiday.  Furthermore, the subject slippers, although marketed as costume/dress-up <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, are made of a very durable construction and are fully functional as footwear, regardless of how decorated.  \r\t\r\tThe subject “Hello Kitty” slippers are distinguishable from the slippers which were the subject of NY C80677, dated November 4, 1997, and PD C87051, dated May 13, 1998, in that the merchandise addressed in NY C80677 and PD C87051 were of flimsy construction and not capable of functional use.  Unlike the subject slippers, they were not lined, and did not have a means by which the slipper could be held onto the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  As such, the subject slippers are not classifiable in heading 9505, HTSUS.\r\r\tChapter 64, Note 1(f) states that this chapter does not cover toy footwear.  As we have already determined that the subject merchandise, by its design and construction, is precluded from classification as “toy footwear”, we can proceed in our analysis.  Note 4(a) to chapter 64 states that “[t]he material of the upper shall be taken to be the constituent material having the greatest external surface area, no account being taken of accessories or reinforcements such as ankle patches, edging, ornamentation, buckles, tabs, eyelet stays or similar attachments.”  Note 4(b) to chapter 64 states that “[t]he constituent material of the outer sole shall be taken to be the material having the greatest surface area in contact with the ground, no account being taken of accessories or reinforcements such as spikes, bars, nails, protectors or similar attachments.”  The EN to chapter 64, HTSUS, state that the outer sole is the part of the footwear which, when in use, is in contact with the ground.  As the subject merchandise is composed of an upper of  100 percent polyester fabric and an outer sole of 100 percent vinyl, the appropriate classification for this merchandise is in heading 6404, HTSUS, as footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics and uppers of textile materials.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tThe subject “Hello Kitty” Princess slippers are correctly classified in subheading 6404.19.3580, HTSUSA, which provides for, footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: footwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except footwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper: other: other: for other persons.  The applicable general column one rate of duty is 37.5 percent ad valorem.\r\r\tDue to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation (the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the restraint (quota/visa) categories, your client should contact the local Customs office prior to importing the merchandise to determine the current status of any import restraints or requirements.\r\r\r\r\t\t\t\t\t\tSincerely,\r\r\r\r\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn Durant, Director\r\t\t\t\t\t\tCommercial Rulings Division\t\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/2000/963428.doc"",""id"":17086,""rulingNumber"":""963428"",""subject"":""Classification of “Hello Kitty” Princess Ballet Slippers"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""2000-02-15T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""E84196"",""087336"",""C80677"",""C87051""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6404.19.3580""]}"

W.\rSuite 504\rWashington, D.C.  20036\r\rRE: Classification of knit garment for the lower torso and legs;\r    Tights (6115) v. Trousers (6104); HK 117/91(a) & HK117/91(b)\r\rDear Mr. Lai:\r\r     This ruling is in response to your request of May 30, 1991,\ron behalf of H.C. Prange Co., regarding the classification of a\rfine knit garment designed to cover the lower torso and legs.  A\rsample garment, style s/3544, was received with your request.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The sample, style s/3544, is constructed of fine knit fabric\rconsisting of 95 percent cotton/5 percent spandex fibers.  The\rgarment has an elasticized self-fabric waistband, a diamond-\rshaped gusset in the crotch and hemmed leg bottoms.  It is form-\rfitting and covers the lower torso and legs.\r\r     Other style numbers were mentioned in your letter--styles\r3545-ID, 3546-ID and 3547-ID.  In regard to those styles, you\rindicate they are essentially the same, differing only in color.\rWe will assume the same is true of the submitted sample.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Is the submitted sample, style s/3544, classifiable as\rtights of heading 6115, HTSUSA, or as trousers of heading 6104,\rHTSUSA?\r\r                               -2-\r\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, provided such\rheadings or notes do not otherwise require, according to [the\rremaining GRIs taken in order].\""\r\r     Customs takes note of the fact that the garment at issue is\rpart of a class of garments which are relatively new creations of\rthe fashion industry, as is the use of the term \""leggings\"" to\rdescribe them.  The term \""leggings\"" by which they are known\rcommercially was not in wide-spread use when the current tariff\rwas adopted.  However, the tariff does contain a provision which\rincludes leggings, i.e., heading 6406, HTSUSA, which provides\rfor, inter alia, gaiters, leggings and similar articles.  A\rgaiter is defined in The American Heritage Dictionary, (2nd\rCollege Ed. 1982), as:\r\r     1. A leather or heavy cloth covering for the legs extending\r     from the instep to the ankle or knee. 2. An ankle-high shoe\r     with elastic sides. 3. An overshoe with a cloth top.\r\rFrom the same source, leggings are defined as:\r\r     A leg covering of material such as canvas or leather.\r\rFairchild's Dictionary of Fashion, (2nd Ed. 1988), defines\rlegging as:\r\r     Covering for leg and ankle extending to knee or sometimes\r     secured by stirrup strap under arch of <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Worn in 19th\r     c. by armed services and by civilian men.  See PUTTEE and\r     GAITER.  Worn by women in suede, patent, and fabric in late\r     1960s.\r\r     It seems clear from the above definitions that the leggings\rclassified in heading 6406, HTSUSA, are not the same merchandise\rthat is at issue here.\r\r     The garment at issue is similar to garments classified in\rHRL 088454 of October 11, 1991.  The following lengthy analysis\ris taken largely from that ruling.\r\r     In determining the proper classification of the garment at\rissue, two headings clearly merit consideration.  These are\rheading 6104, HTSUSA, which provides for, inter alia, trousers,\rbreeches and shorts, and heading 6115, HTSUSA, which provides\rfor, inter alia, tights.\r\r                               -3-\r\r\r     It is a well-established tenet of customs law that tariff\rterms are construed in accordance with their common and\rcommercial meanings and that the common meaning of a tariff term\ris a question of law.  Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. United\rStates, 7 CIT 178, 182, 585 F. Supp. 649 (1984), aff'd, 753 F.2d\r1061 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  It has been asserted that the garments at\rissue here are of a class of garments which have been long known\rcommercially and commonly as tights and therefore classifiable as\rtights under heading 6115, HTSUSA.\r\r     The HTSUSA and the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized\rSystem are silent on the meaning of the term tights.  However,\rtrousers are defined in the Explanatory Notes as:\r\r     garments which envelop each leg separately, covering the\r     knees and usually reaching down to or below the ankles;\r     these garments usually stop at the waist; the presence of\r     braces does not cause these garments to lose the essential\r     character of trousers.\r\r     Heading 6115, HTSUSA, provides, in full, for panty hose,\rtights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings\rfor varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted\ror crocheted.  As the tariff is silent regarding the meaning of\rtights, it is reasonable and proper to look to lexicographic\rsources.  The statutory canon of construction \""noscitur a sociis\""\ris useful in determining the common and commercial meaning of the\rterm tights.  Accordingly, Customs has researched various\rlexicographic sources to discern the common meaning of trousers\rand of tights, hose and hosiery.  The following pertinent\rdefinitions were found.\r\r     TROUSERS\r\r          An outer garment of men or boys, extending from the\r          waist to the knee or, oftener and almost always with\r          men, to the ankle, and covering each leg separately.\r          Orig. they were of the nature of long hose or tight\r          drawers and were worn esp. by sailors and soldiers.\r          Webster's New International Dictionary, Unabridged\r          (2nd Ed., 1939)\r\r          A usually loose-fitting outer garment for the lower\r          part of the body, having individual leg portions that\r          reach typically to the ankle but sometimes to any of\r          various other points from the upper leg down, worn esp.\r          by men and boys.

Bruce Duncan Co., 50 CCPA 43, 46, C.A.D. 817\r(1963), \""the merchandise itself may be strong evidence of use.\""\rThe sample garment is form-fitting and covers the lower torso and\rlegs, however, upon examination Customs believes it to be more in\rthe nature of trousers, than hosiery.  The above-cited\rdefinitions of trousers indicate that they are garments which\rcover the lower torso from the waist to the ankle or, sometimes,\rsimply to the knee, and cover each leg separately.  At least one\r                               -6-\r\r\rdefinition above illustrates that trousers may be close-fitting\rdepending on the fashion.  Additionally, Customs notes that\ralthough the cited definitions refer to trousers as garments worn\respecially by men or boys, women too <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> trousers.  Therefore,\rit would appear that the garment at issue is within the\rdefinition of trousers, including the definition contained in the\rExplanatory Notes of the Harmonized System.\r\r     The meaning of the term tights was examined by the Customs\rCourt in Children's Hose Inc., v. United States, 55 Cust. Ct. 6,\rC.D. 2547 (1965).  In that case, the court stated:\r\r     [T]he court may take judicial notice of the fact that\r     leotards or tights whether worn by children or women are\r     designed to be at least partially utilized under an\r     outergarment and partially exposed, depending upon the age\r     of the wearer and the purpose for which they are worn.  It\r     would, therefore, seem that if a portion of this imported\r     merchandise is underwear, a portion of it is not underwear.\r     By the same token, while the exposed portion may be\r     outerwear, the portion concealed would not be outerwear.\r     Therefore, the articles at bar are more than underwear and\r     more than outerwear.  They are, therefore, in fact \""neither\r     fish nor fowl.\""  (at 9 and 10)\r\rIt is clear from the language of the court, that tights are\rgarments which are partially underwear and partially outerwear.\rThe extent to which the garment is exposed to view is dependent\rupon the age of the wearer and the purpose for which the garment\ris worn.  This interpretation would follow some of the previously\rcited definitions for tights which describe them as knitted pants\rand stockings in one piece or underpants and stockings knit in\rone piece.\r\r     In United States v. Great Pacific Co., Shui Tai & Co., 23\rCCPA 319, 324, T.D. 48192, the court stated:\r\r     A common meaning, having been once established and\r     determined by a court, will be presumed to continue until\r     the language is changed by subsequent legislation.\r\rHowever, the tariff schedules in force at the time of Children's\rHose did not have a provision for tights as the current tariff\rdoes, nor did it have a provision for trousers.  Therefore, while\rthe determination of the court regarding the meaning of the term\rtights and the manner in which they are designed to be worn is\rinstructive in this case, it is not determinative because the\rterm tights was not part of the statutory language of the tariff\rat the time of Children's Hose.  The meaning of an eo nomine\rclassification is determined as of the time of the enactment of\rthe tariff provision.  FAG Bearings, Ltd. v. United States, 9 CIT\r                               -7-\r\r\r227, 228 (1985)  In this case, the HTSUSA (of which heading 6115\rwhich provides for tights is part) was enacted as part of the\rOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, P.L. 100-418,\rTitle I, sec. 1201, 102 Stat. 1147 (1988), and became effective\ron January 1, 1989.  Nonetheless, Customs does not believe the\rcommon meaning of the term tights changed much between 1965 and\r1989.\r\r     In deciding if the subject garment is within the eo nomine\rclassification for tights, Customs may consider the use of the\rmerchandise.  United States v. Quon Quon Co., 46 CCPA 70, 73,\rC.A.D. 699 (1959).  Customs interprets the use of the merchandise\rto include the manner in which it is worn as well as the reasons\rfor which it is worn.\r\r     In your letter, you state that due to the form-fitting\rdesign of the garment, it is not suitable to be worn as outerwear\rwithout an upper body garment that conceals the lower torso.  We\rdisagree.  Customs recognizes that the garment at issue herein\rbelongs to a class of garments known commercially as leggings.\rThese garments are generally worn in conjunction with a garment\rwhich just barely covers the lower torso, i.e., reaches just\rbelow the hip area.  Consequently, the portion of the leggings\rwhich covers the lower torso is exposed to view as the wearer\rreaches or bends or moves about in the course of normal activity.\rAdditionally, these garments are not always worn with a garment\rwhich covers the lower torso.  They may be worn without such a\rgarment according to the discretion of the wearer.  Customs\rbelieves the donning of another garment to cover the lower torso\rwhen wearing leggings such as the garment at issue is a function\rof fashion and the personal perception of the individual\rregarding her own body image and how best to flatter it.  It is\rnot a matter of necessity as it would be in the case of tights.\rAs the court noted in Children's Hose, tights consist of a\rportion which is not intended to be exposed, which is partially\runderwear.  Customs believes the same cannot be said of the\rsubject garment.  It is not partially underwear.  It may be worn\ras street <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> without a garment to cover the lower torso if the\rwearer so chooses.  Tights, on the other hand, if worn as street\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, must be worn with another garment covering the lower torso.\r\r     In researching this classification ruling, Customs has\rexamined advertising material for leggings similar in appearance\rto the sample garment.  It is interesting to find that in the\rFall & Winter 1990 J.C. Penney Catalog, garments which are\rsimilar in appearance to the garment at issue are identified in\rthe catalog as pants.  They are identified as ankle-length pants,\rcapri pants or simply pants.  In one instance, a garment is\ridentified as leggings in the descriptive material, yet\ridentified as pants in a photograph of the garment.  Leggings of\rthe type at issue herein are often advertised either before,\r                               -8-\r\r\rafter, or alongside advertisements for tights.  But, they are not\radvertised as tights or to be worn necessarily in the same manner\ras tights.  Additionally, these garments are not displayed in the\rmanner of tights, folded and packaged, but in the manner of\rtrousers, individually hung on hangers.  These garments are\rseparately identified by the fashion industry and the retail\rindustry and this is evident by available advertising material\rand the manner in which the garments are displayed in stores.\r\r     Customs contacted store buyers regarding leggings and\rtights.  Two of these buyers were cooperative in answering\rquestions regarding leggings and tights.  Of course, the\rinformation provided was based on their personal opinions,\rhowever, we believe it to be informative considering their\rpositions.  Based on those conversations, Customs learned of the\rdifference in the display of leggings from tights.  Each buyer\rviewed tights and leggings as different articles.  One buyer\rstated that leggings are sold in every department of the store;\rthey are not limited to simply one area.  This same buyer\rindicated that tights and leggings are worn differently.\rLeggings may be worn with an oversized sweater, but tights would\rnot be so worn.  The other buyer indicated she would not view\rleggings as pants or tights and that leggings are usually of a\rheavier fabric than tights.  Customs views this information as\rsupportive that tights and leggings, at least the ones at issue\rherein, are distinct articles and thus, differently classified.\r\r     We now return to the garment itself, for it is the garment\ron which the classification decision is based.  As stated\rearlier, Customs does not regard the garment at issue herein as\rhosiery.  On the contrary, this garment falls within an emerging\rclass of merchandise known commercially as leggings and worn, in\rCustoms view, principally as trousers by women and girls.\rCustoms decision that the garment at issue herein is not a form\rof hosiery, but is a pair of trousers, is based upon, not only\rthe manner in which the garment is worn, but also the overall\rappearance of the garment and the cotton/spandex knit fabric\rfrom which the garment is made.  Customs believes the fabric\rutilized in manufacturing this garment is not fabric of the kind\rtypically used in the manufacture of hosiery articles.  Instead,\rit is not unlike cotton/spandex blend knit fabrics commonly used\rtoday to make form-fitting dresses, skirts and tops.\r\r     Having determined that the garment at issue herein is of a\rclass of garments worn as trousers and commercially known as\rleggings, it is necessary to express caution in interpreting this\rruling.  The term leggings is being used liberally by the fashion\rindustry to identify a range of garments which have in common the\rcharacteristic of being form-fitting.  As with any range, there\rare extremes.  Customs is of the view that that is true of\rleggings.  There are garments currently identified as leggings\r                               -9-\r\r\rwhich may be classifiable as tights depending on the nature of\rthe garments and whether they fall within the meaning of tights\ras expressed by the court in Children's Hose.\r\r     The garment at issue herein is not of the fringe.  It is\rwithin what Customs perceives to be in the main stream.  It is\ramong the majority of garments identified as leggings.  These\rgarments are worn in the manner of trousers, not tights.  In\raddition, they are constructed of fabric not normally associated\rwith hosiery articles such as tights, but of fabric in common use\rin today's ready-to-<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> garments.  Therefore, the subject\rgarment is classifiable as women's trousers of heading 6104,\rHTSUSA.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The garment at issue, style s/3544, is classified as\rwomen's trousers of heading 6104.62.2010, HTSUSA.  Garments\rclassified in this heading are subject to duty at a rate of 16.7\rpercent ad valorem and fall within textile category 348.\r\r     In HRL 088454 of October 11, 1991, Customs Headquarters\rruled on a garment much like style s/3544.  That ruling was the\rfirst Headquarters ruling on the classification of garments known\ras leggings.  Customs acknowledges that there has been some\rconfusion regarding the classification of these garments.  Much\rof the concern about the classification, however, revolves\raround the category designation.\r\r     Category designation is the responsibility of the Committee\rfor the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA).  On\rSeptember 10, 1991, in an effort to clarify the scope of\rcategories 359/659 with regard to tights contained therein, CITA\rissued a directive to the Commissioner of Customs to amend the\rdefinition of tights contained in the Guidelines for the\rReporting of Imported Products in Various Textile and Apparel\rCategories, CIE 13/88.  This directive appeared in the September\r16, 1991, issue of the Federal Register.  Pursuant to the\rdirective from CITA, Customs will apply the new guideline\rregarding tights to determine the proper textile category for\rgoods exported to the United States on or after January 1, 1992.\r\r     Due to the apparent confusion regarding the classification\rof leggings, Customs will delay the effective date of this ruling\runtil January 1, 1992.  This action is taken pursuant to 19 CFR\r177.9(3)(1).  In addition, with the agreement of the Commerce\rDepartment and in accordance with the September 10, 1991,\rdirective from CITA, Customs will accept category 359 visas for\rthe entries which were the reason for your request, i.e., entries\r#4200759319-9 and #4200759439-5.\r\r                              -10-\r\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, the visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since\rpart categories are the result of international bilateral\ragreements which are subject to frequent renegotiations and\rchanges, to obtain the most current information available, we\rsuggest you check, close to the time of shipment, the Status\rReport On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an internal\rissuance of the U.S. Customs Service which is updated weekly and\ris available for inspection at your local Customs office.\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories, you should contact your local\rCustoms office prior to importation of this merchandise to\rdetermine the current status of any import restraints or\rrequirements.\r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director\r                                   Commercial Rulings Division\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1991/089582.doc"",""id"":5076,""rulingNumber"":""089582"",""subject"":""Classification of knit garment for the lower torso and legs;    Tights (6115) v.

O’Hare\rOMI Corporation\r1710 Cumberland Point Drive, Suite 5\rMarietta, Georgia 30067\r\rRE:  Reconsideration and Affirmance of HQ 960466; Additional\rShoe Considered; Not Orthopedic Footwear; Footwear for\rDiscomfort due to Disease, Disorder, Deformity\r\rDear Mr. O’Hare:\r\rThis letter is in response to your request of March 27, 1998, for reconsideration of Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 960466, issued February 18, 1998, which itself was a reconsideration of New York Ruling Letter (NY) B82189, issued February 26, 1997, concerning the classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) of footwear identified as orthopedic shoes made in China.  A sample shoe described as the “Gripper” was submitted in connection with the request to reconsider NY B82189.  Additional sample shoes described as “Pedors” have been submitted in connection with the current request and these have been examined and considered.\r\rFACTS:\r\rIn HQ 960466, issued February 18, 1998, Customs affirmed NY B82189, issued February 26, 1997, in which Customs had classified the “Gripper” in subheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA, the provision for “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: Other: Other: Valued over\r\t-2-\r\r\f$6.50 but not over $12 per pair.”  Both HQ 960466 and NY B82189 were issued to Tower Group International, Inc., on behalf of Colonial Shoe Company.  \r\rIn HQ 960466, the “Gripper” was described as having an ankle height neoprene upper with an external surface composed of textile fabric.  The upper was closed by means of a hook and loop fabric fastener strap at the ankle.  The shoe had an ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer midsole, onto which was cemented a flexible rubber outer sole.  The shoe was mass-produced in standard sizes and sold in pairs.  Marketing materials, excerpts from publications, and other information submitted, indicated that the shoe was listed as a device with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was medically prescribed and obtained through medical supply outlets, and was thought by many medical professionals to benefit sufferers of diabetes, arthritis, corns, hammertoes, lupus, bunions, neuromas, neuropathy, scleroderma, etc.\r\rThe newly submitted sample is identified as an “orthopaedic shoe” and described as the “Pedors” shoe.  It is said to be marketed to, and fitted solely by, the medical community and is packaged as such.  The Pedors shoe appears to conform substantially to the description of the Gripper shoe above.  It is stated, however, that the Pedors shoe is quite distinct in design from the original Gripper shoe, having extra depth in the toe, a removable inner sole, a stronger sole plate, and more support on the lateral and medial counters and heel cup.  The shoe is available in full and half sizes and in three widths, and is said to comply with the guidelines given by the “Therapeutic Shoe Bill.”  The current request for reconsideration is based upon your standing as the initial distributor, specification developer, and owner of the Grippers and Pedors products.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhether the shoes are classified as footwear under heading 6404, or as orthopedic footwear under heading 9021, HTSUS.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification under the HTSUS is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the  terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative\r\t-3-\r\r\fSection or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI may then be applied.  The Explanatory Notes (EN) to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, which represent the official interpretation of the tariff at the international level, facilitate classification under the HTSUS by offering guidance in understanding the scope of the headings and GRI.\r\rHeading 6404, HTSUSA, covers “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials.”  Note 1(e) to chapter 64, HTSUSA, states that “This Chapter does not cover: Orthopedic footwear or other orthopedic appliances, or parts thereof (heading 9021).”  \r\rAmong other merchandise, heading 9021, HTSUSA, covers “Orthopedic appliances, including crutches...splints and other fracture appliances...other appliances which are worn or carried...to compensate for a defect or disability; parts and accessories thereof.”  The EN to heading 9021 indicate that\rorthopedic appliances are appliances for: “(i) Preventing or correcting bodily deformities; or (ii) Supporting or holding organs following an illness or operation.”  In pertinent part, they include:\r\r(6) Orthopaedic footwear, having an enlarged leather stiffener which may be reinforced with a metal or cork frame, made only to measure.\r\r(7) Special insoles, made to measure.\r\rWith respect to the “Gripper” shoe classified in HQ 960466, we find that essentially no new evidence has been submitted upon which a change in that shoe’s classification may be based.  HQ 960466 is therefore affirmed. \r\rWe further find that the Pedors shoes (like the Gripper) are footwear designed, intended, and prescribed, for persons suffering <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> discomfort from various diseases, disorders, and deformities.  The purpose of such shoes, however, is to provide comfort to feet already afflicted with abnormalities, and they are not principally used to “prevent or correct” deformities.  The uppers of the shoes are soft and, despite the presence in the Pedors of a stronger sole plate, the soles are flexible, not rigid (as are the soles of post-operative orthopedic shoes).  As the EN also state, articles that are properly classified under\r\t-4-\r\r\fheading 9021, HTSUSA, are “made to measure,” that being, constructed in accordance with measurements taken on the one intended to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> the article.  The Pedors are ready to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, are sold in pairs, and are available in most sizes.  Such footwear is not properly classified as orthopedic appliances under heading 9021.\r\rAs you may be aware, in March 1996, at its 17th session, the World Customs Organization’s Harmonized System Committee (HSC) examined the classification of mass-produced, post-operative footwear designed for patients recovering from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> surgery or metatarsal injury.  The specific representative sample examined by the committee was identified as the “Technol Post-Op” shoe.  The committee voted to strictly interpret the EN to heading 9021, HS, which as previously noted, indicate that orthopedic footwear included in the heading is limited to that which is “made to measure.”  On this basis, the committee determined that the “Technol Post-Op” shoe was precluded from classification in heading 9021, HS, in that it was mass-produced.  Classification of the “Technol Post-Op” shoe was deemed appropriate in either subheading 6402.99 or 6404.19, HS, depending upon the composition of the outer sole and upper.  The committee’s decision to classify the “Technol Post-Op” shoe in chapter 64 was memorialized in an Amendment to the Compendium of Classification Opinions, which was adopted at the 18th session of the HSC.  It is Customs position that the HSC’s classification decision should be followed.  Action is therefore being taken to revoke several rulings in which mass-produced, post-operative footwear has been classified in subheading 9021.90.80, HTSUS. \r\rThe essential characteristics and features of the “Pedors” shoes are not similar to those of the post-operative shoes discussed above.  Although the shoes are listed as medical devices with the FDA, and their specification developer and distributor is registered with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service and the FDA, Customs classifies goods in accordance with the HTSUSA, not by the attributes or significance that other government agencies or departments assign to imported products or their development for purposes other than tariff classification.  In light of the above analysis, we find that the Pedors shoes are classified in subheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA. \r\rHOLDING:\r\rThe shoes described as “Pedors” are classified in subheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA, the provision for “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics...and uppers of textile materials: Footwear\r\t-5-\r\rwith outer soles of rubber or plastics: Other: Other: Valued over $6.50 [6 dollars and 50 cents] but not over $12 [twelve dollars] per pair.”  The general column one duty rate is 90 cents per pair plus 20 percent ad valorem.\r\r\fHQ 960466, issued February 18, 1998, is hereby affirmed.\r\r\r Sincerely,\r\r\r\r\r\r John Durant, Director\r Commercial Rulings Division\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1999/961556.doc"",""id"":16137,""rulingNumber"":""961556"",""subject"":""Reconsideration and Affirmance of HQ 960466; AdditionalShoe Considered; Not Orthopedic Footwear; Footwear forDiscomfort due to Disease, Disorder, Deformity"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1999-05-10T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""960466"",""B82189""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6404.19.80""]}"

International Inc., requesting\rthe classification of various styles of women's knit garments for\rthe lower torso and legs.  Subsequent submissions have also been\rtaken into account in reaching the decision herein.  Samples of\rthe garments were received by this office.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     Six samples were submitted to this office.  The styles\rreceived were CT010, CT011, CT012, CT048, CT090 and CT027B.\r\r     All of the garments are made of lightweight, somewhat sheer,\rfine knit fabric consisting of 54 percent cotton, 35 percent\rpolyester and 11 percent spandex.  Each garment has a cotton\rlined diamond-shaped gusset in the crotch, a 3/4-inch elasticized\rself-fabric waistband, inseams along each leg, and front and back\rcenter seams on the torso portion of the garment.  The garments\rvary in length from above the knee to ankle-length and vary in\rthe finishing of the leg bottoms.  Some styles have hemmed leg\rbottoms and some are finished with two-inch lace.\r\r     The garments will be imported from Taiwan packaged in\rindividual plastic bags. You indicate they can be sold directly\rto the consumer in the condition as imported and that the\rgarments are principally sold and marketed by Krystal K. and by\rretail stores as tights.  Additionally, you have cited NYRL\r                               -2-\r\r\r816878 of January 29, 1986, issued to Danstop International Inc.,\rthe predecessor to Krystal K, in which garments fitting the\rgeneral description of the goods at issue were classified as\rtights.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Are the submitted sample garments classifiable as tights of\rheading 6115, HTSUSA, or as trousers of heading 6104, HTSUSA, or\ras other garments of heading 6114, HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Customs has received several submissions regarding the issue\rinvolved in this case.  In responding herein, we will attempt to\raddress the various arguments which you have presented and which\rhave been presented to us by others on the classification of\rthese garments and garments of the same class or kind.\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, provided such\rheadings or notes do not otherwise require, according to [the\rremaining GRIs taken in order].\""\r\r     In HRL 088454 of October 11, 1991, Customs ruled that\rcertain garments known as leggings are classifiable as pants and\rnot as tights.  In that ruling care was taken to point out that\rwhile Customs believes the majority of garments commercially\rknown as leggings are classifiable as pants, not all leggings\rwill necessarily be so classified.  This caution was given due to\rpopularity of the term leggings and the liberal use of that term\rin the fashion industry and by retailers in describing a wide\rrange of form-fitting knit garments for the lower torso and legs.\r\r     Customs examined the meaning of the term tights for tariff\rpurposes in great length in HRL 088454.  In that ruling, Customs\rconcluded that tights are garments which are partially underwear\rand partially outerwear, partially intended to be exposed and\rpartially intended to be covered.  See, Children's Hose Inc., v.\rUnited States, 55 Cust. Ct. 6, C.D. 2547 (1965).  Customs also\rdetermined, based on the various definitions which were reviewed,\rthe language of heading 6115, HTSUSA, and applying the doctrine\rof \""noscitur a sociis\"", that tights are a form of hosiery.\r\r     If tights are a form of hosiery, it becomes necessary to\rdetermine if the goods at issue are commonly and commercially\rrecognized as hosiery.  Customs has consulted lexicographic\rsources and sought information from the hosiery industry\rregarding the industry's definition of hosiery.  Various sources\r                               -3-\r\r\rdefine hosiery, in pertinent part, in the following ways:\r\r     1.a. Stockings and socks: HOSE. b. Chiefly Brit. Stockings,\r     socks, and underclothing. 2. The business of a hosier.\r     Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary (1984)\r\r     1. A collective term for knitted or woven hose, especially\r     women's stockings.  *  *  *  2. A term used in Great Britain\r     to indicate any knitted article.  Fairchild's Dictionary of\r     Textiles (1970).\r\r     Knit or woven coverings for the feet and legs designed to be\r     worn inside shoes, particularly women's stockings and\r     tights; also socks for men, women, and children.  The New\r     Encyclopaedia Britannica Vol. 5, at 147 (1975) (found at\r     beginning of discussion of hosiery)\r\rVarious sources define hose as:\r\r     A leg covering, in modern use covering also the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, but\r     formerly sometimes reaching only to the ankle; a stocking or\r     stockings; Close-fitting covering for the legs and waist of\r     the general nature of tights, as formerly worn, often\r     fastened to the doublet by ribbons or strings called points;\r     later, breeches reaching only to the knee.  Webster's New\r     International Dictionary, Unabridged (2nd Ed., 1939)\r\r     A cloth leg covering that reaches down to the ankle and\r     sometimes covers the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>; stocking, sock (a pair of -) -\r     usu. used in pl.; A close-fitting garment similar to\r     tights that covers the body from the waist to and sometimes\r     including the feet and is usu. attached to a doublet by\r     points.  Webster's Third New International Dictionary,\r     Unabridged (1986)\r\r     Stockings, or covering for lower leg and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, usually knit\r     or woven.  Formerly not made to cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.; Tights, or\r     hose reaching to the waist, formerly fastened to doublet\r     with points.  Mary Brooks Picken,  The Fashion Dictionary at\r     195 (1973)\r\r     The above definitions are helpful, but somewhat imprecise.\rReferences to tights in the definitions do not clarify the issue\rfor Customs as the meaning of tights is also at issue.\rAdditionally, the definition above of hosiery as \""a close-fitting\rgarment that covers the body from the waist to and sometimes\rincluding the feet\""  could arguably describe certain types of\rtrousers.  (See trousers definitions below).\r\r     In your submission regarding the issue of the meaning of\r\""hosiery\"", you state a belief that the term is rather broad,\r                               -4-\r\r\rencompassing a wide variety of products.  Customs agrees the term\rencompasses many products and believes these products to have a\rcommon characteristic.  In an effort to determine the common\rcharacteristic(s) of articles regarded as hosiery, Customs turned\rto the hosiery industry for clarification regarding the\rcommercial understanding of the term \""hosiery.\""  It is a well-\restablished tenet of customs law that tariff terms are construed\rin accordance with their common and commercial meanings and that\rthe common meaning of a tariff term is a question of law.  Toyota\rMotor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. United States, 7 CIT 178, 182, 585\rF. Supp. 649 (1984), aff'd, 753 F.2d 1061 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\rHowever, whenever the common meaning is somewhat indefinite, \""it\ris proper to consider the interpretation commonly placed upon it\rin the particular industry involved.\""  United States V. Colonial\rCommerce Co., Ltd., et al., 44 CCPA 18, C.A.D. 629 (1956).\r\r     The information Customs has received from sources in the\rhosiery industry, such as the National Association of Hosiery\rManufacturers (NAHM), indicates that the industry views\rmanufactured, as opposed to hand knit, hosiery as articles\rproduced on hosiery machines.  These machines are circular\rknitting machines with small diameter heads.  They produce\rseamless, tubular fabric which is finished to make stockings,\rpantyhose, tights, socks, etc.  You have submitted information on\rthe manufacturing process of these garments and it indicates they\rare made from fabric which is produced on circular knitting\rmachines.  However, these knitting machines are different from\rthose utilized by the hosiery industry.  They have large diameter\rheads and produce tubular fabric which then must be cut and sewn\rto produce an article.  While it is true that full-fashioned\rhosiery is produced by a cut-and-sew method, according to the\rNAHM this form of hosiery has all but disappeared from the\rmarket.  In fact, the NAHM stopped gathering statistical data on\rfull-fashioned hosiery twenty years ago (1972) because it made\rup such an insignificant portion of the market, i.e., less than\rfive percent.  Garments such as those at issue herein, i.e.,\rgarments which are clearly produced from a cut-and-sew process,\rare not viewed by the NAHM as articles of the hosiery industry,\rbut as articles of the apparel industry.\r\r     In deciding if the goods at issue are hosiery, Customs has\rlooked at not only the means of manufacture and the perspective\rof the hosiery industry, but also the marketing of these goods.\rThese garments are generally found near the hosiery section in\rdepartment stores or sometimes as part of a subsection within the\rhosiery section, but always as a distinct section unto itself\ridentified as bodywear or activewear.\r\r     Based on the information culled from lexicographic sources\rand the hosiery industry, in addition to marketing, Customs does\rnot view the goods at issue herein as hosiery.  As heading 6115,\r                               -5-\r\r\rHTSUSA, is limited by its terms to articles of hosiery, these\rgarments cannot be classified as tights of that heading.\r\r     Since these goods are not classifiable within heading 6115,\rHTSUSA, Customs must determine if they are properly classified as\rtrousers or shorts (depending on the length) of heading 6104,\rHTSUSA, or as other garments of heading 6114, HTSUSA.\r\r     In your submission of June 6, 1991, it is argued that the\rgarments at issue are sold to retail stores as body garments;\rthat they are imported in polybags (much like traditional\r\""underwear\"") and can be sold directly to the consumer in their\rcondition as imported.  It is also pointed out that the garments\rare of fine knit fabric, have a significant amount of spandex,\rsmall elasticized waistbands and cotton-lined gussets which allow\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> without undergarments.  It is argued that the physical\rcharacteristics of these garments make them unsuitable for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>\routside the athletic arena unless the lower torso is covered.\rFurther, it is argued that these physical characteristics, in\rconjunction with the manner in which the garments are packaged,\rmarketed and sold leads to a conclusion that the goods should be\rclassified as tights of heading 6115, HTSUSA.  Having eliminated\rthat classification possibility, Customs will examine these\rfactors as a possible basis for classifying these garments as\rother garments of 6114, HTSUSA, rather than as trousers of\rheading 6104, HTSUSA.\r\r     Various sources define trousers as follows:\r\r     An outer garment of men or boys, extending from the waist to\r     the knee or, oftener and almost always with men, to the\r     ankle, and covering each leg separately.  Orig. they were of\r     the nature of long hose or tight drawers and were worn esp.\r     by sailors and soldiers.  Webster's New International\r     Dictionary, Unabridged  (2nd Ed., 1939)\r\r     A usually loose-fitting outer garment for the lower part of\r     the body, having individual leg portions that reach\r     typically to the ankle but sometimes to any of various other\r     points from the upper leg down, worn esp. by men and boys.\r     The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1983)\r\r     An outer garment extending from the waist to the ankle or\r     sometimes only to or just below the knee, covering each leg\r     separately, made close-fitting or loose-fitting in\r     accordance with the fashion of different periods, and worn\r     typically by men and boys.  Webster's Third New\r     International Dictionary, Unabridged (1986) [Emphasis added]\r\r     Outer garment extending from the waist to below the knee,\r     covering each leg separately.  Worn mostly by men and boys.\r                               -6-\r\r\r     Formerly, very tight, similar to long hose.  Mary Brooks\r     Picken,  The Fashion Dictionary at 390 (1973)\r\r     The above-cited definitions of trousers indicate that they\rare garments which cover the lower torso from the waist to the\rankle or, sometimes, simply to the knee, and cover each leg\rseparately.  At least two definitions above illustrate that\rtrousers may be close-fitting depending on the fashion.\r\r     Trousers are defined in the Explanatory Notes to the\rHarmonized System as:\r\r     garments which envelop each leg separately, covering the\r     knees and usually reaching down to or below the ankles;\r     these garments usually stop at the waist; the presence of\r     braces does not cause these garments to lose the essential\r     character of trousers.\r\rIt is clear from the foregoing that the goods at issue fall\rwithin the general definition of trousers.\r\r     In deciding if the subject garments are within the eo nomine\rclassification for trousers, Customs may consider the use of the\rmerchandise.  United States v. Quon Quon Co., 46 CCPA 70, 73,\rC.A.D. 699 (1959).  Customs interprets the use of the\rmerchandise to include the manner in which it is worn as well as\rthe reasons for which it is worn.\r\r     Customs acknowledges that in this case, the garments at\rissue are designed and manufactured for exercise use.  The\rpresence of the cotton-lined gusset (eliminating the need for\runderwear) and the use of a high percentage of spandex in a\rlightweight knit fabric support such a conclusion.  However, we\rreject the contention that because the garments are designed for\ruse during exercise, dance or other athletic activities that\rsomehow makes them \""more than\"" or \""other than\"" pants.  Sweat\rpants and sweat shirts are garments worn especially during\rexercise, but that use does not make them \""more than\"" or \""other\rthan\"" pants or shirts.  Garments such as jogging shorts with\rliners for support, bike shorts with padding in the crotch and\rsun dresses with bust support sewn in clearly possess features\rwhich eliminate the need to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> certain traditional under-\rgarments.  These features are not features which generally come\rto mind when one considers the general class of \""shorts\"" or\r\""dresses\"".  However, the presence of such features is\rinsufficient to remove these garments from the general class to\rwhich they belong, it simply identifies the garments as\rparticular types of shorts or dresses.  Heading 6104, HTSUSA, is\rnot limited by the language of the heading and therefore\r                               -7-\r\r\rincludes all forms of women's knit pants or trousers.  See,\rNootka Packing Co. et al. v. United States, 22 CCPA 464, T.D.\r47464 (1935).\r\r     Customs has examined another Krystal K sample garment, style\rCT-168, not submitted by you or your client, but featuring the\rsame fabric composition and the same styling features.  The\rdifference between this sample and those submitted to Customs by\ryou on your client's behalf is that unlike the submitted samples\rwhich were of dyed knit fabric, this sample was printed.  The\rsamples are clearly of the same class or kind.  While it could be\rclaimed that the submitted samples of dyed fabrics are somewhat\rsheer when worn, depending on the judgement of the observer,\rthus necessitating they be worn with a garment covering the lower\rtorso; the printed sample is not sheer and does not require the\rcovering of the lower torso.  Yet, these garments are virtually\rthe same and thus, should be classified the same.  Additionally,\rthe sheerness and hence modesty argument falls short when one\rconsiders that other garments, for instance, white linen trousers\ror certain women's blouses, may be considered somewhat sheer.\rThis factor simply requires the donning of appropriate\rundergarments.\r\r     In Mast Industries v. United States, 9 CIT 549, 552 (1985),\raff'd, 786 F. 2d 1144 (1986), the court, in determining that the\rgarments at issue therein were nightwear, found that the\rmerchandise was designed, manufactured, marketed and used as\rnightwear.  In this case, Customs does not dispute that these\rgarments are designed, manufactured, marketed and used as\rexercise <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  Customs does have problems accepting that the\rgarments are designed, manufactured, marketed and used as tights,\ror that because the garments are used as exercise <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> this\rmakes them classifiable as other than trousers.  We believe the\rgarments have dual uses, i.e., in the gym or on the street.  In\rthis case, the principal use of this merchandise, whether it is\rfor exercise or for fashion, does not affect its commercial\ridentity.  To classify one garment as trousers because it is\rprincipally worn for fashion and a virtually identical garment as\rother than trousers because it is principally worn for exercise\rwould lead to inconsistent classification decisions on\ressentially identical merchandise.\r\r     Customs believes that the marketing material which has been\rreviewed supports our view that these garments, regardless of\ruse, are pants and considered such in the marketplace.  Customs\rhas reviewed material submitted by you on your client's behalf\rand advertisements placed in magazines, newspapers and catalogs,\rwhich have been sent in from Customs various field offices.\r\r     In your submission, you included your client's Fall '91\rcatalog.  The cover identifies the catalog as \""Basic\r                               -8-\r\r\rActivewear/Bodywear\"".  Throughout the catalog, goods such as\rthose at issue are identified as leggings or tights.  While\rCustoms will always consider such material, it must also\rrecognize that such material may be self-serving.  Each of the\rsamples before us, except one, has a hang tag identifying the\rgarment as either sports <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> or active <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  None of the\rgarments at issue has a tag or label identifying it as tights.\rWe have examined advertising material for garments much like\rthose at issue herein.  We have not thus far found any\rspecifically for Krystal K's merchandise, but believe it is of\rthe same class or kind as similar merchandise marketed by Gilda\rMarx, Marika, Danskin and Jacques Moret.  Customs has found\rseveral advertisements for garments by these companies in which\rthe goods are identified as bike shorts, capri pants, ankle-\rlength pants, knee pants and pedal pushers.  These goods have\rbeen identified as such in advertisements for such retailers as\rJ.C. Penney, Oshman's, Spiegel, and Sears.  Advertisements for\rlocal retailers have appeared in newspapers such as the L.A.\rTimes and the Washington Post identifying these goods in the same\rmanner.  Therefore, while Customs considers your client's catalog\rinformative, particularly in regard to the design and\rmanufacture of these garments, we believe that there exists\rsufficient evidence as to the marketing of garments of the same\rclass or kind at the consumer level to rebut any claim that\rdesignation of the goods as tights in the submitted catalog\rshould be sufficient to support a classification of the goods as\rtights of heading 6115, HTSUSA, or preclude classification as\rpants of heading 6104, HTSUSA.  Customs has collected and\rcontinues collecting advertisements on goods of the same class or\rkind as your client's in which the garments are identified as\rsome type of shorts or pants.\r\r     In regard to the packaging of the garments in polybags,\rwhile these garments are imported in this condition and \""can be\rsold directly to the consumer in their condition as imported,\""\ryou do not indicate if in fact the garments are sold to consumers\rin this condition.  Garments of the same class or kind are\rdisplayed much in the manner of trousers, i.e., on hangers, in\rdepartment stores and specialty stores around the country.\r\r     Lastly, NYRL 816878 of January 29, 1986, cited by you as\rsupport for classification of the subject goods as tights, dealt\rwith different merchandise.  The two garments in that ruling\rwhich have the same fiber composition and general description of\rthe goods at issue herein were made of different fabric.  Those\rgarments were made of 2 X 2 rib knit fabric.  Therefore, Customs\rviews this ruling as without weight in considering the matter at\rhand.\r\r                               -9-\r\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     General Rule of Interpretation 3(a) states that the heading\rwhich provides the most specific description is favored over\rheadings providing a more general description.  Based on GRI 3(a)\rand not being satisfied that the subject garments are \""more than\""\ror \""other than\"" pants, the garments at issue are properly\rclassified in heading 6104, HTSUSA, as trousers or shorts\r(depending on the length of the garment) and not as tights of\rheading 6115, HTSUSA, or in the provision for other garments,\rheading 6114, HTSUSA.\r\r     Styles CT027B, CT010, CT090, and CT011 are classifiable as\rwomen's cotton knit pants in subheading 6104.62.2010, HTSUSA\rtextile category 348, dutiable at 16.7 percent ad valorem.\rStyles CT012 and CT048 are classifiable as women's cotton knit\rshorts in subheading 6104.62.2030, HTSUSA textile category 348,\rdutiable at 16.7 percent ad valorem.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel category may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, the visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since\rpart categories are the result of international bilateral\ragreements which are subject to frequent renegotiations and\rchanges, to obtain the most current information available, we\rsuggest you check, close to the time of shipment, the Status\rReport On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an internal\rissuance of the U.S. Customs Service which is updated weekly and\ris available for inspection at your local Customs office.\r\r     Due to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation\r(the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the\rrestraint (quota/visa) categories, you should contact your local\rCustoms office prior to importation of this merchandise to\rdetermine the current status of any import restraints or\rrequirements.\r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director\r                                   Commercial Rulings Division\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1992/089852.doc"",""id"":6251,""rulingNumber"":""089852"",""subject"":""Classification of women's knit garments for the lower torso    and legs; tights vs. trousers vs. other garments; 6115,    HTSUSA vs. 6104, HTSUSA, vs. 6114, HTSUSA"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1992-02-19T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""088454"",""816878""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6104.62.2010"",""6104.62.2030""]}"

This information may be verified at the time of importation.\r\rThe submitted half-pair samples identified as items MZX005, WZX005 and WZX006 are five-toe “<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> glove” type shoes with unit molded outer soles composed of rubber/plastics.  All three uppers have a closure device at the instep and are composed predominately of lycra and nylon mesh, both of which are considered textile materials.  You provided F.O.B. values between $15 and $17/pair for all three shoes. \r\rIn a prior ruling issued to you by this office, you stated that the same style shoe as the ones submitted with this request was designed for indoor and outdoor <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> by both men and women.  In that ruling, we referenced Statistical Note 1(c) to Chapter 64, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides in pertinent part that “footwear for women” covers footwear of American women’s size 4 and larger, whether for females or of types commonly worn by both sexes.  This note meets the definition of “unisex” for tariff classification purposes.  \r\rThe applicable subheading for items MZX005, WZX005 and WZX006 will be 6404.19.9060, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber/plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: not sports or athletic footwear; not footwear with open toes or open heels and not footwear of the slip-on type; valued over $12.00/pair: for women.

Accordingly, the footwear would be considered not legally marked under the provisions of 19 C.F.R. 134.11 which states, \""every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit, in such manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the U.S. the English name of the country of origin of the article.\""\r\rThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\rA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

Box 55580\rPortland, Oregon 97238\r\rRE:  Country of origin marking of sandals imported from England\r\rDear Sir:  \r\r\tThis is in reference to letters dated August 27, 1999, and July 13, 2001, from counsel, on behalf of R. Griggs Group, Ltd. (“Griggs”), requesting a ruling concerning the country of origin marking requirements of certain sandals imported from England.  Samples of the completed sandals and sandal components have been submitted.   \r\rFACTS:\r\r\tThe sandals, identified as “Dr. Martens Airware sandals” (“Doc Martens”), are produced in Thailand and England.  The initial process begins in England, where the design for the sandals is developed and tested to ensure that the footwear is properly balanced, the design is fully functional, and will ensure <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> comfort.  A full set of working patterns for the shoe is then produced, so that sample footwear can be made.  The sample footwear is produced in England, tested, and specifications are amended as necessary.  Once the footwear is ready for full production, final specifications are communicated to the other production facilities.  \r\rThailand\r\r\tThe upper production begins with leather from the U.S. and England shipped by the supplier to Thailand, where it is cut into leather pieces and straps.  Very thin pieces of suede leather from England are also cut for the lining of the sandal.  The leather and/or the lining is skived (a process which evens out the thickness of the leather) where necessary.  Components for the sandal upper are then stitched, and various attachments and fasteners are added.  The suede lining is attached to the inside of the upper components with adhesive and trimmed, and the components of the upper are assembled and stitched together.  As part of this process, a strip of leather is attached as the bottom perimeter of the upper.  This strip hangs straight down the outside of the upper, and will extend over and beyond the footbed, once the footbed has been added.\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\r2  \r\r\r\r\r\tThe footbed is a piece of polyurethane next to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> in the shoe.  It is designed to provide the first layer of comfort to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Counsel states that it does not function as a sole and is not intended to have any use as a wearing surface, as it would abrade very quickly if it were subjected to any friction or <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>. In this regard, counsel notes that under the ball of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, for example, the footbed is only about 3/16” thick.  \r\r\tThe footbed is supplied to the Thai contractor by a subcontractor.  It is molded in a mold that has a thin piece of fabric material called the rib placed around the inside perimeter of the mold bottom.  Polyurethane materials from England are poured into the mold, with this rib in place.  The liquids react and harden in a few minutes.  A paper-thin strip of suede lining material is then glued to the top of the footbed.  \r\r\tThe leather upper is then given its first attachment to the footbed by gluing the inside edges of the leather strip hanging down the sides of the upper to the parallel outside edges of the footbed, using a cement adhesive.  A form is inserted into the upper, because this will allow the upper to be clamped into a sidewall press.  The leather strip is pressed against the footbed using the sidewall pressing process to allow the adhesive cement to bond under pressure.  No part of the upper is attached to the bottom of the footbed, so no part of the upper is bent inward to a horizontal position in the bottom closing process.\r\r\tThe uppers are then placed heel to toe on top of each other and packed, compressed, for shipping to Griggs’ facilities in England.  The Thai production process is said to involve both skilled labor operations (e.g., cutting leather, skiving, stitching), as well as unskilled operations (e.g., production of the footbed, gluing of the upper to the footbed).\r\rEngland\r\r1. Manufacture of Welt Compound and Welt\r\r\tThe welt compound is manufactured by measuring the proprietary mix of ingredients in the formula and blending them together in a high-speed internal mixer at carefully calibrated temperatures.  The material is then heated to form a molten “spaghetti.”  The “spaghetti” is cut into pellets and cooled for use in the actual welt manufacture.\r\r\tThe welt itself is manufactured on a profile extrusion machine designed to produce the exact size, shape and thickness of welt needed.  The extruded welt is then used in a Goodyear welting process, with the added step patented by the original \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\r3\r\r\r\r\rGerman inventor of these shoes.  Counsel states that the welt is critical to the proper design and construction of all Doc Martens’ shoes.  It connects the upper unit to the sole unit, while simultaneously trapping an air cushion between the two parts of the shoe, and also gives the shoe its distinctive durability, as well as creating a joint that is not weakened by immersion in water.\r\rManufacture of Sole Compound and Outer Sole\r\rThe process of producing the outer sole begins with production of sole compound, using a sophisticated process analogous to that used for producing welt compound, and employing a secret formula of ingredients.\r\rOnce produced, the sole compound, which is made up of thermoplastic granules, is moved to a hopper on the plastic molding machines.  These machines contain specially designed molds for each particular size and style of Doc Martens bottom being produced at that time.  The mold designs, made in England by Griggs, include a specially shaped well on the inside of the sole to accommodate the cushioning component which must be added to produce the proper Doc Martens bottom, as well as U.K. registered designs on the bottom wearing surface of the outer sole.\r\rThe granules are fed into machines and carefully heated as they move toward the front end of a machine barrel.  When they plasticise, they are injected from the machine nozzle under pressure into the mold cavity.  The mold is locked and cooled, until the sole reaches the consistency required for the Doc Martens air cushion outer sole.  At this point, the outer sole component is demolded and made ready for the next manufacturing step.\r\rManufacture of Felt Bottom Pads and Foam Inserts\r\rThe shaped felt bottom pads and the shaped foam inserts are cut for the well of the outsole from large sheets of material.  Both the felt and the foam sheets are sourced in England.  Computer-controlled cutting pressers are used to cut the felt and the foam into their respective patterns, which are shaped precisely to the shoe into which they must fit.\r\rForce Lasting and Heat Setting\r\rInitiation of force lasting of the uppers, followed by heat setting on most sandal models, are the next key manufacturing steps.  (Lasting is the process of shaping or forming the upper to fit the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>; heat setting assists and improves shape retention.)  \r\r\t\t\t\t\t4\r\r\r\r\r\rThe force lasting is done by hand.  It requires the operator to select the specific last used for the sandal model – all of these lasts are made in England – and force the forepart of the last into the upper sandal.  The last is shortened, and the back part of the upper is positioned over the seat of the last.  Most of the lasts are then locked and lengthened, tightening the upper onto the last, and conforming the leather to the shape of the last.  (A few lasts are merely forced, without lengthening.)  The force lasting process continues through the subsequent manufacturing steps, until the shoe is fully produced.  Counsel states that this process is the only means to ensure that the upper is well formed to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, and is not distorted by the subsequent manufacturing steps needed to construct the whole shoe.\r \r\tHeat setting follows the initiation of the force lasting described below.  After the last has been forced into the upper, the heat setting machine provides a successive application of moisture and heat which relaxes the leather, and subsequently helps both to conform the uppers very tightly to the shape of the last, and to retain that shape.  The upper is allowed to cool following the heat setting, and then proceeds to the next manufacturing step. \r\rStaple Lasting, Trimming and Welt Sewing\r\rStaple lasting, trimming and welt sewing are key steps in the final closing of the upper and the intricate construction of the actual sandal.  The specially designed PVC welt is prepared for sewing using the Goodyear welting process.  A skilled operator uses a technique called staple lasting, which carefully staples through the piece of leather on the side of the upper, and into the rib of the footbed.  This bends the upper  \rleather toward the horizontal for the first time, and further secures the upper to the footbed.  \r\r\tOnce the staple lasting is complete, another skilled operator does a preliminary trimming operation on the bottom strip of the upper, using an upper trimmer.  This is necessary to allow the welt sewing.  A third skilled operator uses a welt sewing machine\rto sew the welt to both the overhanging piece of the leather on the upper and to the rib on the footbed, using welt thread made in England. \r\r\tThe operator then cuts the welt and carefully stitches over the welt joint.  This process provides the final securing of the upper to the footbed, and provides the high quality, sturdy connection between the welt and the upper needed for this shoe.\r\r\r\r\t\t\t\t\t\t5\r\r\r\r\rCutting Upper Leather and Welt\r\rOnce this process is complete, another skilled operator takes the upper and uses an inseam trimmer to cut the upper leather and the welt very carefully, so that they are level with the top of the rib.  This step is critical, because if it is not done properly, the sole unit will not fit correctly to the welt, and the shoe will not be securely constructed.\r\r7.  Shoe Component Assembly and Welding of Welt\r\r\tAt this point, the first component of the cushioning feature in the sandal bottom is introduced.  Hot molten adhesive is run down the middle of the bottom side of the footbed, and a specially sized felt pad that has been cut for the shoe is glued on and allowed to cool.  Next, a second bottom-cushioning element is introduced.  The specially cut foam pad is placed into the “well,” i.e., the specially shaped inside cavity, of the sole unit.\r\r\tThe partially cushioned sole unit is now placed into a position where it can be temporarily secured to the welt.  In this skilled operation, an operator attaches the welt to the sole in precisely the correct location at four points on the sandal, spot welding the welt and sole unit together.  Care is needed in this operation to ensure that the upper and bottom are fully and correctly aligned.  An error here will distort the shape of the shoe.\r\r\tThe next skilled operation makes a permanent, full connection between the sole unit and the welt.  This processing operation, which was patented by the original manufacturers, also has the effect of trapping a cushion of air in the sole that provides further cushioning.  A sophisticated and unique piece of machinery called a heat sealing machine that Griggs manufactures itself, holds the welt and sole components together, and the skilled operator uses a heated blade to seal the welting and sole together around the entire shoe in a manner that traps the air cushion between the sole unit and the upper unit.    \r\r8.  Production of Sole Edge\r\rThe next operation, which also requires use of a skilled machine operator, creates the distinctive grooved sole edge pattern across the outside of the welting and \rthe sole, and finishes the sole edge.  This grooved sole edge, together with the yellow stitching, is at the heart of Doc Martens’ trade dress.\r\r\r\r\t\t\t\t\t\t6\r\r\r\r\r8.  Testing\r\rThe last is now opened and the shoe is released.  The welt seal is tested to ensure it is proper.  If it is not, the shoe is returned to the manufacturing line for correction.  If the welt is secure, the shoe moves to the next stage.\r\rToning, Cleaning and Other Operations\r\rThe leather is toned and cleaned by hand to correct creases and ensure a uniform surface.  Then, the sandal is packed with paper or cardboard to assist in shape retention, a label is attached, and the shoe is inspected by quality control personnel.  Footwear passing inspection is boxed and packed for shipping.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat are the country of origin marking requirements for the sandals imported from England?   \r \rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r  \rThe marking statute, section 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. §1304), provides that, unless excepted, every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly and permanently as the nature of the article (or its container) will permit, in such a manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the U.S. the English name of the country of origin of the article.  Part 134, Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 134) implements the country of origin marking requirements and exceptions of 19 U.S.C. §1304. \r  \r Section 134.1(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR §134.1(b)), defines country of  \rorigin as:\r  \rThe country of manufacture, production or growth of any article of foreign origin entering the U.S.  Further work or material added to an article in another country must effect a substantial transformation in order to render such other country the country of origin within the meaning of this part; however for a good of a NAFTA country, the NAFTA Marking Rules will determine the country of origin.  \r\rA substantial transformation occurs \""when an article emerges from a manufacturing process with a new name, character, or use which differs from that of \r\r\t\t\t\t\t\t7\r\r\r\r\rthe original material subjected to the process.  The Torrington Company v. United States, 764 F.2d 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\r\rAccordingly, in order to ascertain the country of origin marking requirements for the imported sandals, we must determine whether the sandal uppers imported into England from Thailand undergo a substantial transformation as a result of the operations performed in England.  \r\rIn Uniroyal Inc. v. United States, 3 C.I.T. 220, 542 F. Supp. 1026 (1982), aff'd, 702 F.2d 1022 (Fed Cir. 1983), the merchandise before the Court of International Trade consisted of lasted \""footwear uppers consisting of complete shoes except for an outsole...,\"" manufactured in Indonesia and imported into the U.S. where a pre-shaped rubber outsole was affixed and the complete shoe (moccasins) was sold to retailers.  The issue before the court was whether the addition of the outsoles substantially transformed the uppers so that the uppers did not have to be individually marked as a product of Indonesia. \r\rAfter carefully examining both the imported upper and the finished shoe, the court concluded that the imported upper did not lose its distinct identity in the finished moccasin and was the very essence of the completed shoe.  This was so even though the imported upper could not be sold to or worn by consumers without the heavy rubber outsole being attached and even though following attachment of the rubber outsole the shoe was called by a different name, a deck shoe, rather than an upper or a moccasin.  In reaching its decision, the court compared the time, cost of materials and labor involved in producing the upper abroad versus the process of attaching the outsole in the U.S., including the number of highly skilled operations performed in the U.S. and abroad.  The court concluded that “the manufacturing operation performed by [the U.S. processor] is a minor assembly operation which requires only a small fraction of the time and cost involved in producing the uppers.”  Consequently, the court found that a substantial transformation of the upper had not occurred since the attachment of the outsole to the upper was a minor manufacturing or combining process which left the identity of the upper intact.  \r\rCounsel believes that Uniroyal lends support to Griggs’ position that the sandal uppers undergo a substantial transformation in England, in view of the significant cost of material and labor which accrue in that country versus such costs in Thailand, plus the complexity and sophistication of the operations which take place in England in comparison to the operations in Thailand.  \r\rIt appears that in Uniroyal, the court was concerned that processing in the U.S. which resulted in an article with a different name, character and use than the \r\t\t\t\t\t\t8\r\r\r\r\rimported article should not be regarded as a substantial transformation if the cost, material or added value associated with the domestic processing is negligible or insignificant compared to the cost, material or value added abroad.  However, Uniroyal did not preclude the use of other tests used by the courts to determine the issue of substantial transformation.  Thus, in National Hand Tool Corp. v. United States, 16 CIT 308, 312 (1992), aff’d, 989 F.2d 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the court stated that \rthe determination of a substantial transformation must be based on the totality of the evidence, and applied a 3-pronged test utilizing name, character, and use, in \rdetermining whether a substantial transformation had occurred.  In that case, the court discounted plaintiff's argument that a substantial transformation should be found based on the value of the processing performed in the U.S., which plaintiff described as significant, but decided the issue based solely on name, character and use.\r\rCounsel argues that the sandal uppers as imported into England are “unformed,” as at this point they are not lasted or molded, or, counsel states, otherwise given shape in Thailand to the form of a human <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Counsel contends that the principles set forth in Customs rulings on footwear as well as the NAFTA country of origin marking rules further support a finding that the “unformed” uppers undergo a substantial transformation as a result of the processing in England.  \r\rIn Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL) 721106 dated August 23, 1983, Customs held that moccasin uppers that were fully sewn and closed abroad, were not considered to have undergone a substantial transformation in the U.S. as a result of force lasting and “bottoming” (attachment of the sole).  In that case, the imported uppers were  described as “fully constructed, sewn and closed prior to the force lasting.”  We noted that the “force lasting” which occurred in the U.S. after the upper was fully constructed could not be compared to lasting which occurs during construction of the upper as that type of lasting provided a measure of substantiality or completion of the articles upon importation.  In HRL 953017 dated January 29, 1993, Customs held that the attachment of an outer sole in the U.S. did not result in a substantial transformation as the boot upper which was “fully closed and sewn” had attained its final shape upon importation although it had not been shaped by “lasting, molding or otherwise.”  See also HRL 732692 dated January 16, 1990 (formed uppers used in the production of moccasins were not substantially transformed as a result of the additional processing performed in the U.S.  Although not back-lasted, upon importation the uppers had much of their ultimate shape, form and size and thus the basic appearance of shoes); and HRL 732490 dated September 22, 1989 (two sample leather moccasin uppers - one with an open midsole the other with a closed midsole - were not substantially transformed although the U.S. processing included lasting and sole laying.)\r\r  \r\t\t\t\t\t9\r\r\r\rHowever, in HRL 555431 dated April 9, 1990, Customs held that the joining of unlasted, unformed slipper uppers to outersoles in an insular possession constituted a substantial transformation. In that case, we stated that the “parts” of footwear imported into the insular possession underwent a complex assembly process (lasting, stitching, inverting the inner sole and stitching the toe closed) in order to transform the parts into completed slippers.  See also HRL 735338 dated January 28, 1994 (completely open and unlasted uppers of athletic footwear imported into Italy did not have the very essence of a completed shoe, and were substantially transformed as a result of the processing performed in Italy.)\r\t\t\t\t\rNAFTA Marking Rules – Formed Uppers\r\r\tCounsel states that the NAFTA Marking Rules support its position that the uppers are unformed upon importation into England since if imported from a NAFTA country (Canada or Mexico), the subject uppers would undergo a tariff shift as a result of the additional processing in the exporting country, and the country of origin would be the country where the uppers were finished.\r\rIt is our opinion that the imported sandals are properly classifiable in heading 6403, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The applicable change in tariff classification set out in section 102.20(k), Section XII, Chapters 64 through 67, 6401-6405 of the regulations provides:\r\r6401-6405 .... A change to heading 6401 through 6405 from any other heading \r     outside that group, except from formed uppers.  [Emphasis added.]\r\rAdditional U.S. Note 4 to chapter 64, HTSUS, provides as follows:\r\rProvisions of subheading 6406.10 for \""formed uppers\"" cover uppers, with closed bottoms, which have been shaped by lasting, molding or otherwise but not by simply closing at the bottom.  [Emphasis added.]\r\rWe have consulted with the Chief, Textile Branch, as to whether the footwear components imported into England are “formed” uppers.  The following reflects the response of that office:  \r     \rThe goods imported into England consist of uppers with closed bottoms.  Although the upper at issue has not been shaped by lasting, examination of the sample indicates that it has been shaped by other significant means which appear to satisfy what the legal note requires of articles that are classified in subheading 6406.10, HTSUS.  The subject upper has been shaped by the \r\r\t\t\t\t\t\t10\r\r\r\rsubstantial and intricate sewing together of numerous pieces and straps of precision-cut (in Thailand), high quality leather into a shape which conforms to \rthe contours of the heel, sides, and top portions of a human <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  This assembled upper (with Dr. Martens® buckle, hole-punched strap, and embossed AirWair® logo) is then bonded with adhesive around the entire perimeter of a sturdy footbed (also referred to as an \""underfoot\"").  The footbed is composed of molded polyurethane plastic and features an exterior rib that is typical of an insole for welted footwear.  The molded plastic footbed is shaped like the sole of a human <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The downward projecting rib runs just inside and parallel to the footbed's perimeter.  The rib is designed to be secured together (eventually) with a PVC welt and the leather upper by a strong chainstitch (a key feature of high quality, machine welted construction).  \r\rThe imported article also has a thin piece of suede leather attached with adhesive to, and completely covering, the top of the footbed where the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> will rest.  Pieces of suede are also glued and stitched to the interior of the upper.  All the suede pieces are cut in Thailand.  Together they form the lining of what will become the sandal.  The exterior (bottom) of the plastic footbed is marked with an \""8\"" to indicate a U.K. size 8 (which equates to a U.S. size 9).  Counsel refers to this hard molded plastic as merely a \""foam footbed.... not intended to have any use as a wearing surface....[which] would abrade and pit very quickly if it were subjected to any friction or <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.\""  The material is not composed of foam plastic, however, and its suitability for use in walking is irrelevant.  The material is extremely durable, as evidenced by the fact that it will anchor the innermost stitching of the sandal's machine welted construction.  Further, the plastic surface can barely be scratched by rubbing it with a sharp metal object.  Although the leather of the imported \""formed upper\"" is not rigid or in the shape of a last, it clearly possesses the shape of a size 8 (U.K.) human <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The National [Commodity] Import Specialist notes that the leather upper materials of the sample he examined retained their shape even after removal of the plastic footbed (a step not taken in any of the actual manufacturing processes). \r\rThe manufacturing processes performed in England which affect the upper essentially consist of \""force lasting,\"" stapling the upper to the rib, \""heat setting,\"" trimming of upper material extending below the footbed, stitching the upper to the rib and welt, and cutting the upper and welt to the level of the rib.  Griggs contends that it is the bending of the upper \""inward to the horizontal\"" through \""force lasting\"" and \""heat setting\"" which causes the upper to be \""formed.\""  In this case, the bend to the horizontal is barely perceptible due to the fact that the construction of welted footwear requires attachment of the upper material to the vertically oriented rib.  The written submission and presentation, however, \r\r\t\t\t\t\t\t11\r\r\r\r\rmake much of the \""intentional\"" shaping and molding effects of force lasting and heat setting.  Force lasting essentially involves a \""hand operation\"" to force the \rlast into the upper.  Heat setting involves the application of moisture and heat to relax the leather and conform it to the shape of the last.  These lasting processes are intended to help the sandal retain the shape of the last for as long as possible.  It appears, however, that exposure to elements such as sun and water, through normal use of the finished sandal beside the pool, walking in the rain, river rafting, etc., would soon cause the stiffened shape of the force lasted, heat set upper to resemble the \""broken in\"" look of the \""formed uppers\"" imported into England.  For the convenience of transport, the uppers are imported into England packed heel to toe in a compressed state.  Although they have not yet assumed the shape of the last, the uppers have already been formed in the shape of a <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of certain size and shape.  \r\rGriggs relies upon certain guidance contained in Treasury Decision (T.D.) \r93-88, particularly a part in which the term \""formed uppers\"" is defined in the negative.  The selected guidance states:\r\r\""Formed uppers\"" does not include:\r\r2.  Any upper which is completely unlasted, i.e., no part of it has been bent (lasted) inward to the horizontal.\r\rThis cited excerpt, however, is applicable to uppers that are intended to attain their shape only by lasting, not by molding or by the other means provided for in Additional U.S. Note 4 to chapter 64, HTSUS.  Further, in the first paragraph of T.D. 93-88 it is stated that \""[t]hese definitions are provided merely as guidelines.  They are not to be construed as Customs rulings.\""  Counsel makes no reference to other guidance contained in T.D. 93-88, particularly where it is \rstated that the term:\r\r\""Formed uppers\"" includes:\r\r1.  In general, all items which have a layer of material between most of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and the ground, and which, after lacing or buckling, if needed, will stay on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> if worn in the condition as imported and which are shaped to fit the human <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.\r\rAs previously noted, the subject articles have a complete layer between the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and the ground, and would, after buckling, stay on most feet, which measure size 8 (U.K.) because they are shaped to fit the human <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  \r12\r\r\r\r\rIn light of the above, it is our conclusion that the articles imported into England from Thailand constitute \""formed uppers.\""  As such, they are classifiable in subheading 6406.10.05, which provides for “Parts of footwear (including uppers whether or not attached to soles other than outer soles)…:  Uppers and parts thereof, other than stiffeners: Formed uppers: Of leather or composition leather: For men, youths and boys.” \r\rThe opinion of the Textile Branch that the uppers are “formed” and classifiable in subheading 6406.10.05, HTSUS, represents the position of the Customs Service.  In accordance with this opinion, we find that despite the uppers not being back-lasted, they have much of the ultimate shape, form and size of the completed sandals.  As in Uniroyal, and in HRL 732692, above, we consider the formed uppers imported from Thailand to be substantially complete footwear, which constitutes the very essence of the completed product.  Accordingly, we find that these uppers do not undergo a substantial transformation as a result of the additional processing performed in England.\rTherefore, the origin of the imported sandals for country of origin marking purposes is Thailand and they should be so marked. \r\rAlternative Upper Construction\r\r\tAs an alternative to the upper construction described above, Griggs requests that Customs provide guidance with respect to a manufacturing process as follows:\r\rThe footbed would be molded to contain a hole of one to two inches.  The shape of the hole likely would mimic the shape of a filled in “U.”  After importation into England, the hole would be filled using a plug constructed outside of England, and imported separately from the upper.  The sandal upper would also be lasted in England, as is currently the case, and it would be turned into a welted sandal using the same basic manufacturing steps that were outlined in Griggs’ August 27, 1999 ruling request.\r\t\rAs noted, the sample sandal uppers, which are the subject of this ruling request, are fully closed at the bottom through staple lasting and welt sewing.\r\rGriggs asks whether as a result of such alternative upper construction, Customs would consider the sandal uppers imported from Thailand to be “unformed” uppers for purposes of classification.  Further, Griggs asks whether under this alternative construction, Customs would find that the uppers undergo a substantial transformation in England.  \r\r\r\t\t\t\t\t13\r\r\r\r\rIn HRL 087458 dated September 19, 1990, the sample consisted of a two eyelet moccasin-type leather upper designed for a man's right <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> with an elliptical hole in the bottom approximately 2 1/2 inches long and approximately 7/8 inch wide at one end of \rthe hole and approximately 5/8 inch wide at the opposite end of the hole. We found in that case that since the sample upper had a substantial opening in its bottom, which could only be closed with additional material, it could not be considered a “formed upper” for tariff purposes, as Additional U.S. Note 4 provides for formed uppers with closed bottoms.  Therefore, we held that the operations in the U.S., which included closure of the bottoms with additional material, constituted a substantial transformation of the imported unformed uppers.  See also HRL 085573 dated December 28, 1989 and HRL 085291 dated March 1, 1990.\r\r  In accordance with the principles set forth in HRL 087458 and the other cases cited, Customs would consider the sandal uppers imported into England under the alternative manufacturing operation which Griggs has proposed to be “unformed” uppers for tariff purposes.  The sandal uppers would be closed with additional material in an additional manufacturing process performed in England.  Under this alternative construction, the closure of the bottoms with additional material in England followed by the additional processing as described above will result in a formed upper and will satisfy the substantial transformation test.  Accordingly, under this alternative construction the country of origin of the completed sandals will be England and the sandals should be so marked upon importation.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tBased on the information and samples provided:\r\rScenario No. 1\r\rSandal uppers which are fully closed at the bottom imported from Thailand into England are considered “formed” uppers as they have much of the ultimate shape, form and size of the completed sandals.  As in Uniroyal and in HRL 732692, above, we consider the formed uppers imported from Thailand to be substantially complete footwear, which constitutes the very essence of the completed product.  Accordingly, we \rfind that these uppers do not undergo a substantial transformation as a result of the additional processing performed in England and the country of origin of the completed sandals will be Thailand.\r\r\t\t\t\t\t\t14\r\r\r\r\rScenario No. 2\r\rSandal uppers imported from Thailand into England with a footbed molded to contain a hole of one to two inches are not considered “formed uppers” for tariff purposes.  The operations in England, which include closure of the bottoms and  additional processing leading to the completed sandals, constitutes a substantial transformation of the imported unformed uppers.  See HRL 087458, above.  Accordingly, under this scenario, the country of origin of the completed sandals will be England.  \r\rIt should be noted, however, that Customs is reviewing HRL 087458 and other similar cases with regard to what constitutes a formed upper for purposes of Additional U.S. Note 4.  Any proposed change in these decisions would require notice and comment in the Customs Bulletin pursuant to section 625(c), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1625(c)).\r\r\tPlease advise Claire E.

Therefore, it is classifiable\runder subheading 6403.91.90, HTSUS, which provides for footwear\rwith outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition\rleather and uppers of leather, other footwear, covering the\rankle, other, for other persons or under subheading 6403.99.90,\rHTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber,\rplastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of leather,\rother footwear, other, other, other, for other persons, valued\rover $2.50/pair.\r\r                                2\r\r     You state that the classification set forth in HRL 955960 is\rin error because it disregards the fact that the subject shoes\rare made using male lasts. Further, it asserts an overbroad basis\rfor a tariff provision and it fails to substantiate that 5% or\rmore of the subject shoes are worn by girls.\r\r     Therefore, it is your position that the shoes in issue are\rproperly classifiable under subheading 6403.91.60, HTSUS, which\rprovides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather, or composition leather, other footwear, covering the\rankle, other, for men, youths and boys or under subheading\r6403.99.60, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles\rof rubber, plastics, leather, or composition leather, other\rfootwear, other, other, other, for men, youths and boys.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Whether the subject basketball shoes are for men, youths and\rboys within the purview of Additional U.S. Note l(b) to Chapter\r64, HTSUS.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUS is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRI's). GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, and, provided\rsuch headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to\r[the remaining GRI's].\"" In other words, classification is\rgoverned first by the terms of the headings of the tariff and any\rrelative section or chapter notes.\r\r          Additiona  l U.S.   Note 1 (b)   to   Chapter   64,  \rreads    as\rfollows:\r\r     2.    For  the  purposes  of  this  chapter:\r\r     (b)  The  term  \""footwear for men, youths and boys\""  \r          covers  footwear  of  American youths'  size  11-1/2 \r           and  larger  for  males,  and  does  not   include\r           footwear   commonly   worn   by   both   sexes.\r\r     In the case of Devahni International Inc. v. United States,\r66 Cust. Ct. 229, C.D. 4196 (1971) involving the classification\rof leather sandals, the court stated that \""[i]n this instance\rplaintiff is not seeking to establish that the water buffalo\rsandals in issue are 'commonly worn'  by women,  but rather that\rthey are not 'commonly worn' by women.\"" The court then cited the\rdefinition of the word \""common\"" from Websters Third New\rInternational Dictionary (1966) which states:\r\r\r                                3\r\r\r\r\r     4a        Occurring  or  appearing  frequently  esp.  in \rthe  ordinary \r          course  of  events:   Not  unusual:   Known   or  \rreferred   to\r          widely   or   generally   because   of   frequent  \roccurrence.\r\r     The court then referred to the definition of the word\r\""uncommon\"" from Funk and Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the\rEnglish language (1956) as follows:\r\r     Exceptional,   infrequent,   odd,   peculiar,   rare,  \rsingular   or \r     unusual.\r\rThe court noted that the \""commonly worn\"" concept could not be\rapplied  \""to the class of sandals at bar\""  but solely to the\rindividual type of footwear at issue.\r\r     Your first claim is that the FILA \""M\""\"" Squad Hi-Cut and FILA\r\""M\"" Squad Low Cut basketball shoes should be classified as boys'\rfootwear because they are designed using male lasts.\rSpecifically, the basketball shoes in issue are made with male\rlasts tailored to conform to the shape of boy's feet. Use of male\rlasts renders these shoes inappropriate for use by girls.\rMoreover, girls would cause serious harm to their feet if they\rwere to routinely <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> the FILA 3B36, 3B45 and 3B51 boys'\rbasketball shoes. See affidavit submitted by footwear designer,\rRui Parracho in support of FILA's position.\r\r     The case of A. Zerkowitz & Co. Inc. v. United States, 54\rCust. Ct. 151, C.D. 2525 (1965) was cited in HRL 955960 by\rCustoms in support of its position that the fact that the\rfootwear in issue was made on male lasts is inclusive evidence\rthat the footwear is for \""men, youths and boys.\"" You assert that\rthis case is thirty years old and is distinguishable from the\rclassification issue presented by your client. You note that HRL\r955960 failed to cite the following dicta from the Zerkowitz\rcase:\r\r     Apart from size, differences between male and female lasts\rdo not reflect differences in natural <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> contour .  .  .  54\rCust. Ct. At 160.   (Emphasis added).\r\r     You assert that while the above may have been the case in\r1965, Mr. Parracho's affidavit clearly shows that male and female\rlasts are constructed differently today. Currently,  male and\rfemale lasts reflect differences in natural <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> contours.\rCertainly, Customs is aware that the present-day consumer is more\rknowledgeable of the potentially harmful effect of using\rimproperly fitted shoes for playing basketball than was the 1965\rconsumer.\r\r                                4\r\r     We are not persuaded that because male and female lasts\rreflect differences in natural <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> contours, that females would\rnot <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> a shoe made with a male last.   The court in Zerkowitz \rmade the following relevant comment:\r\r\r          The evidence   shows   a   woman    wearing a   sneaker \r made   with  a \r          male  last    might  have   to   take   a    half  \rsize   smaller   than   she \r          was used to,   say  6-1/2   instead   of   7,   but  \rmost   retail  buyers \r          of   footwear   try   it on   anyway,   as   they  \rhave   learned   to  pay \r          little  reqard  to  the  maker's  alleged  sizes,  and \rthe    trade \r          agrees  with  the  consumer  in  wanting  shoes  toe  \rselected   by \r          actual  trial.  Indeed,   retail   sellers   frequently \r conceal   the \r          sizes.  54 Cust.  Ct. at   160.\r\r          There are so many variations in female <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> sizes that\rit is probable a good number of females would be able to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>\rshoes made on a male last without damaging their feet.\r\r           Your second claim is that HRL 955960 asserts an\roverbroad basis for a tariff provision. You state that the U.S.\rCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in Rico Import Company\rv. United States, Court No. 93-1321, expressly prohibits an\roverbroad basis for a tariff. The Rico Court stated that \""It]he\rassertion of Customs that the reeds even as imported might be\rsplit and would then be suitable for plaiting, strikes us an\roverbroad bases for a tariff. 'The dutiable classification of\rarticles imported must be ascertained by an examination of the\rimported article itself, in the condition in which it was\rimported.' Worthinqton v. Robbins, 139 U.S. 337, 341 (1891).\""\r\r          You maintain that like Rico,   the assertion that the\rFILA basketball shoes may be worn by girls is an overbroad basis\rfor a tariff provision. Further, Customs cannot hinder\rclassification of the basketball shoes in issue on the basis that\rFILA does not produce a girls' basketball shoe. You submit that\rthis reasoning contradicts Rico because it goes beyond\rconsideration of the' imported article itself, and searches for\rthe existence of articles unrelated to those items under\rconsideration. Also, you suggest that under the rationale offered\rby Customs in HRL 955960, any shoe which might be worn by a girl\rmay not be classifiable as men's, youths' and boys' footwear.\r\r          The argument that Customs asserts an overbroad basis\rfor a tariff provision\r by classifying these shoes as \""unisex \"" rather than for men,\ryouths and boys is incorrect.    Unlike the reeds in the Rico\rcase which were used solely for the \rproduction of reeds  for musical instruments, the subject\rbasketball shoes are of \ra type of  shoes that are worn by both sexes. These shoes have no\rdistinguishing feature which would identify them as for males \ronly,  other than that they are made on male  lasts; a  factor of\rwhich the consumer would be unaware.   It appears that you are\r drawing a restrictive base for a tariff provision by asserting \r\r                                5\r\r\rthat these shoes are only for males.\r\r     In the past, Customs has taken the position that footwear is\rconsidered to be commonly worn by both sexes when 5% or more of\rthe footwear will be sold to females. See HRL 951361 dated July\r24, 1992. Your third claim is that Customs has failed to\restablish that 5% or more of the subject FILA basketball shoes\rare commonly worn by girls. In HRL 955960 Customs took the\rposition that females purchase 5% or more of the footwear in\rissue. That conclusion was based on an informal survey of the\rmajor retailers of athletic and other shoes in New York and the\radministrative staff members of a major college women's\rbasketball team.\r\r     You point out that even though the retailers surveyed stated\rthat girls buy shoes in children's shoe departments which do not\rdesignate between boys' and girls' shoes does not establish that\rgirls will not look for the girls' shoes when shopping in the\rchildren's department.\r\r     You state that your own informal survey conducted at New\rYork \""Payless\"" and \""Fayva\"" shoe stores established that young\rgirls  are more likely to purchase athletic shoes that have\rfeminine cartoon characters, e.g., Barbie and the female Power \rRangers.\r\r     You have attached a copy of the questions asked during your\rsurvey and copies of responses from three identified shoe stores\rin the Washington, D.C. area. You ask us to note the small\rpercentage of boy's basketball shoes that may be being sold to\rgirls, and the confirmation of our factual contention that girls'\rshoes fit girls better than boys' shoes.\r\r     It is our observation that the result of your survey of\rthree stores in the Washington, D.C. area is inconclusive. We\rnote that one store indicated that \""[f]ive percent at the most of\rthe 25 pairs of boy's basketball shoes sold on average were\rpurchased for use by girls.\""    Another store indicated that\r\""[o]f these 120 pairs sold on average per month, less than 10\rpairs were purchased for use by girl's.\""    In this instance\rthere is a distinct possibility that more than 5% were sold to\rfemales [even six pairs sold to females would equal 5%].   \rAlthough, there are no records or statistics of what percentage\rof shoes are sold to which sex, we are of the opinion that\rfemales do purchase 5% or more of the footwear in issue.\r\r     In cases such as this where Customs must determine if\rfootwear is worn by both sexes, we examine the manner of\rmarketing the footwear. Consideration is  given to whether the\rcompany markets separate footwear for each sex.  See e.g.,   HRL\r950439   dated   February 19, 1992,   affirmed by  HRL  951361 \rdated  July\r24, 1992.\r\r                                6\r\r     The assertion that FILA does not produce or import\rbasketball shoes for women or girls indicates that their shoes\rare \""unisex\"" rather than men's or boy's. In an article published\rin the New York Times of March 30, 1995, Liz Dolan, VP of\rmarketing at Nike states \""[o]ne in three high school girls play\rsports,\"" and \""[b]ut most women basketball players have bought\rmen's shoes believing they're better.\"" This article further\rstates that \""[a]ccording to the Athletic Footwear Association,\rwomen younger than 18 years old make up 43 percent of all\rscholastic basketball players.\"" Based on these figures it is\rinconceivable that a company would exclude themselves from this\rmarket and not intend to sell their shoes to women and girls.\rConsequently,  the fact that they do not produce or import a\rseparate line for women and girls only leads one to believe that\rthey can capture this market with \""Unisex\"" models which they\rstate are for men and boys.\r\r     In view of the foregoing, it is our opinion that the \""M\""\rSquad Hi-Cut and \""M\"" Squad Low-Cut, styles 3B36, 3B45 and 3B51\rwhich are all within the U.S. male size range of 1-6, do not meet\rthe definition of \""footwear for men, youths and boys\""  in\rAdditional U.S. Note l(b), Chapter 64, HTSUS, as the footwear at\rissue is commonly worn by both sexes.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The styles in issue are classifiable under subheading\r6403.91.90, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles\rof rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of\rleather, other footwear, covering the ankle, other, for other\rpersons or under subheading 6403.99.90, HTSUS, which provides for\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or\rcomposition leather and uppers of leather, other footwear, other,\rother, other, for other persons, valued over $2.50/pair,\rdepending upon whether the footwear covers the ankle.\r     \r     HRL 955960 is affirmed\r\r                              Sincerely,\r\r                              John Durant, Director\r                              Commercial Rulings Division\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1995/957606.doc"",""id"":12568,""rulingNumber"":""957606"",""subject"":""Footwear, basketball; Unisex; Commonly worn by both sexes;     Mens, youths and boys; Additional U.S. Note l(b) to Chapter     64, HTSUS; DeVahni International Inc. v.

The first two products are Camouflage Suits: the Chameleon and Ultra-Light Ghillie Suit.  Both items are constructed of an open work man made fiber knit fabric covered with various types of textile flora camouflage.  The items are not wearing apparel; they are worn solely for camouflage and not for comfort, adornment or decency.  The second item, the Charmeleon Veil, is a camouflage hood constructed of an open work man made fiber knit fabric with attached woodland, mossy or desert/fall leaves of warp knit fabric.  The item covers the head and reaches to the neck.  The Explanatory Note (EN) to Chapter 65 of the HTSUS states that it covers“…hat-shapes, hat-forms, hat bodies and hoods, and hats and other headgear of all kinds, irrespective of the materials from which they are made and of their intended use (daily <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, theatre, disguise, protection, etc.)”.  The third item, the Rifle Rag™ is a complete camouflage system designed for use with any rifle.  It is comprised of a five <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> long elastic band and seven different colors of burlap material (black, brown, tan, desert green, forest green, O.D. Green, and Leaf Green) enabling the user to match any environment.  The EN to heading 9305 states that parts and accessories of the heading include “…protective covers and protective cases, for butts, sights, barrels or breeches.  The phrase “similar items” is not used.  The Rifle Rag™ is not a protective cover for a rifle but rather it is used for camouflage, and as such, it would not be classifiable in Chapter 93 of the HTSUS.  The samples will be returned, as requested by your office.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for the Chameleon and Ultra-Light Ghillie Suits will be 9507.90.8000, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for fishing rods…decoy “birds”…and similar hunting or shooting equipment; parts and accessories thereof: other, including parts and accessories.  The rate of duty will be 9% ad valorem.\r\r           The applicable subheading for the Charmeleon Veil will be 6505.90.6090, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for hats and other headgear, knitted or crocheted, or made up from lace, felt or other textile fabric, in the piece (but not in strips), whether or not lined or trimmed; hair-nets of any material, whether or not lined or trimmed: other: not in part of braid…other: other.  The rate of duty will be 20 cents per kilogram plus 7 percent ad valorem.   \r\r           The applicable subheading for the Rifle Rag™ will be 6307.90.9889, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for other made up articles, including dress patterns: other: other…other: other.

All three of these shoe styles will be valued at over $12 per pair.  \r\r\tStyle #315839 “Men’s Soaker Low” is a below the ankle height athletic shoe that has a predominately textile material upper with a rubber/plastic toe portion, a textile tongue, a lace closure, a rubber/plastic foxing band and a rubber/plastic sole.  Style #315852 “Women’s Soaker Mid” is also an athletic shoe with a predominately textile material upper that cover the ankle and with a rubber/plastic toe portion, a textile tongue, a lace closure, a rubber/plastic foxing band and a rubber/plastic sole.  You state that the textile material uppers on these shoes are made of quick drying, breathable material that allows water and air to move freely in and out of the shoe.  The outsoles are made of a high traction rubber that provides a firm footing even on wet or slippery surfaces.  You also state that the midsoles have built- in drainage channels to direct water out of the shoe through drainage ports in the sidewall of the outsole, thereby not allowing for water to be trapped in the shoe.\r\r\tStyle #315848 “Women’s Soaker Slip-on” is a closed-toe, open-heel slip-on shoe with a textile material upper, a foxing band and a rubber/plastic outer sole.  It also has some of the same construction designs and quick drying material properties of the Nike “Soaker” styles that allow for these shoes to be worn even while walking in water.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for Style #315839 “Men’s Soaker Low” and Style #315852 “Women’s Soaker Mid” will be 6404.11.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for footwear in which the upper’s external surface is predominately textile materials; with outer soles of rubber or plastics; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like; valued over $12.00 per pair.  The rate of duty will be 20% ad valorem.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for Style #315848 “Women’s Soaker Slip-on” will be 6404.19.35, HTSUS, which provides for footwear, in which the upper’s external surface is predominately textile materials (excluding accessories or reinforcements); in which the outer sole’s external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not “athletic footwear”; which has open-toes or open-heels; and which is over 10% by weight of rubber and/or plastics.

The components may be purchased as a set in a nylon drawstring bag or as separate items.  They are close fitting and are designed for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> under scuba diving drysuits to provide warmth and thermal protection in cold water diving.  The items have an outer layer of 78% polyester, 17% nylon, 5% elastane finely knit pile fabric that is napped on the inside surface and a full inner lining of 100% polyester, finely knit pile fabric that is napped on both the inside and outside surfaces.  The flat outer surface provides resistance to abrasion caused by contact with the inside of a drysuit and the inner fabric wicks moisture off the skin, both from perspiration and from drysuit leaks. \r\rThe pullover top, XT500 T, has a mock turtleneck; long, hemmed, raglan sleeves; elastic thumb loops at the sleeve ends; flat lock seams; and a curved, hemmed bottom.  The pants, XT500 L, have a tunnel elastic waistband with an outside drawstring; flat lock seams; and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> stirrups at the ankles.  The socks, XT500 S, are drysuit socks.  They extend above the ankles and have flat lock seams and a hemmed top.\r\rThe items are imported in a rectangular nylon woven bag, XT500 B, that measures 13 inches by 17 inches and has a drawstring closure, reinforced corners, and braided shoulder straps.  The bag is a form of rucksack and is designed for prolonged re-use.\r\rAlthough you state that the garments are unisex, they appear to be made to men’s specifications.  Consequently, the applicable subheading for the pullover top, XT500 T, will be 6110.30.3050, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, (HTS), which provides for: sweaters, pullovers, sweatshirts, waistcoats (vests) and similar articles, knitted or crocheted: of man-made fibers: other: other: other: other: men’s or boys’.

Samples were submitted. \r\r     The item in question consists of the parts of a neoprene\rlaminate stocking <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> chest wader in a partly assembled condition.\rThe importation will consist of chest-high overalls with attached\rpod-shaped bottoms comprised of a three-layer material made from\rtwo layers of knit man-made fiber fabric with a center layer of\rexpanded neoprene rubber. Also included are an unattached pocket\rof neoprene laminate fabric in a rectangular shape, but with\rrounded edges and having a horizontal zipper closure and a buckle;\rsuspenders consisting of woven polyester fabric with buckles on the\rfront and a separate piece of fabric joining the other  pieces in\rthe back; and knee pads comprised of neoprene laminate fabric cut\rto shape. The components will be joined after importation, top edge\rnylon trim, a logo and a hang tag will be added, and threads will\rbe trimmed. The garment appears to be designed for men's <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and\rour reply is based on that.\r\r     You asked for the classification of the components when\rimported together or separately.\r\r     In accordance with General Rule of Interpretation 2(a), which\rgoverns classification of goods under the Harmonized Tariff\rSchedules of the United States (HTS), merchandise which is imported\rin an unfinished state is to be classified in the same manner as\rthe finished good when the imported portion has the essential\rcharacter of the complete or finished article.\rIn addition an unassembled or disassembled product is to be\rclassified in the same manner as the same product in an assembled\rstate. \r\r     The overall with attached feet is considered to have the\ressential character of the finished product. Therefore, based on\rthe above, this item will be classified in the same manner as the\rfinished product when it is imported apart from the other\rcomponents. When all the components are imported together, they\rwill be classified in the same manner as if they were assembled. \r\r     When all the above mentioned parts are imported together, the\rapplicable subheading for this unassembled wader will be\r6113.00.0065, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\r(HTS), which provides for other men's or boys' garments made up of\rknitted or crocheted fabrics of heading 5903, 5906 or 5907:\roveralls and coveralls. The duty rate will be 7.6 percent ad\rvalorem. \r\r     When the various components are imported separately, the\rapplicable subheading for the overall with feet will also be\r6113.00.0065, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\r(HTS). The duty rate will be 7.6 percent ad valorem. The applicable\rsubheading for the pocket and knee pads will be 6117.90.0056, HTS,\rwhich provides for other knitted or crocheted parts of garments of\rman-made fibers. The duty rate will be 15.5 percent ad valorem. The\rapplicable subheading for the polyester web suspenders will be\r6212.90.0030, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\r(HTS), which provides for other suspenders of man-made fibers. The\rduty rate will be 7 percent ad valorem. \r\r     All of the above items fall within textile category\rdesignation 659. Based upon international textile trade agreements\rproducts of Taiwan are subject to quota restraints and the\rrequirement of a visa.\r\r     The designated textile and apparel categories may be\rsubdivided into parts.  If so, visa and quota requirements\rapplicable to the subject merchandise may be affected. Since part\rcategories are the result of international bilateral agreements\rwhich are subject to frequent renegotiations and changes, to obtain\rthe most current information available, we suggest that you check,\rclose to the time of shipment, the Status Report on Current Import\rQuotas (Restraint Levels), an internal issuance of the U.S. Customs\rService, which is available for inspection at your local Customs\roffice. \r\r     This ruling is being issued under the provisions of Section\r177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\r\r     A copy of this ruling letter should be attached to the entry\rdocuments filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

The rate of duty will be 37.5% ad valorem.   \r\r\tStyle #13014 “Cheetah Patterned” and style #13010 “Aqua Blue,” are slip-on shoes with closed toes and open heels, textile uppers and outer soles made up of molded rubber/plastics that feature a thin layer of textile material covering the bottom.  Style #00001 “Solid Black” is a slip-on shoe with a closed toe and heel, a textile upper and an outer sole also made up of molded rubber/plastics that features a thin layer of textile material covering the bottom.\r\rNote 4(b), Chapter 64, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), states that the constituent material of the outer sole shall be taken to be the material having the greatest surface area in contact with the ground, no account being taken of accessories or reinforcements such as spikes, bars, nails, protectors or similar attachments.  The Explanatory Notes to Chapter 64 HTS, offer the term “when in use” to the external surface area of the outer sole determination.\r\r\tThe outer soles of these shoes are composed of unit-molded rubber to which textile fabric has been adhered to the external surface in contact with the ground.  The purpose of the textile material on the surfaces of the rubber soles is not explained.  Due to the fact that this type of footwear is inappropriate for outdoor <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> we feel that the textile material, which accounts for the greatest surface area in contact with the ground when in use, is plausible soling material for footwear of this type, (i.e. for indoor use exclusively).  In this regard, we agree that these shoes have outer soles with external surface areas predominantly of textile material.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for style #13014 “Cheetah Patterned,” style #13010 “Aqua Blue” and style #00001 “Solid Black” will be 6405.20.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear with uppers of textile material and outer soles of other than rubber, plastics leather or composition leather, other.

In that ruling, the insoles were classified under subheading 6406.99.30, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule Annotated (HTSUSA), which provides for: “Parts of footwear . . .; removable insoles, heel cushions and similar articles; gaiters, leggings and similar articles and parts thereof: Other: Of rubber or plastics.”  You contend that the proper classification for the insoles is under subheading 9021.90.8000, HTSUSA, which provides, in pertinent part, for, “Orthopedic appliances, including crutches, surgical belts and trusses; splints and other fracture appliances; artificial parts of the body; hearing aids and other appliances which . . . compensate for a defect or disability; parts and accessories thereof: Other: Other.”\r\r\tCustoms notes that on April 23, 1993, Customs issued NY 884996, to Mr. Norman Krieger on your behalf.  The article under consideration in NY 884996, was the same article (Orthofit 9000) that was considered in NY F89221, and that is the subject of this ruling.  In both of the New York rulings Customs classified the Orthofit 9000 under subheading 6406.99.30.  On July 25, 2001, Customs published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking governing administrative rulings issued under 19 CFR Part 177.  Customs Bulletin, Vol. 35, No. 30.  The proposed regulations governing rulemaking adopted a “two-bites-at-the-apple” principle.  Under the proposed regulations, this request for reconsideration would not be entertained.\rFACTS: \r\rThe submitted sample is an insole, \""Tri Hawk Orthofit 9000,\"" which is designed for the treatment of <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> ailments by podiatrists and orthopedic surgeons.  The insole is a thin, stiff piece of plastic.  It is described as an insole that the medical professional modifies to fit the patient.  After identifying the problem, the doctor heats the insole until it is pliable, holds the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> on the \""orthotic\"" until it cools and hardens, and adds posts or wedges as needed.  The insole itself is stiff and inflexible both before and after modification.  The insole is mass-produced, imported in pairs and is sold in pairs to physicians.  However, it is not necessary that the treating physician use both the left and the right insole on a single patient.  The Orthofit 9000 is designed to fit into any style of footwear and is an alternative for patients who cannot afford the cost of \""orthotics\"" or laboratory-made devices.  \r\u000BISSUE\r\r\tWhether insoles that are mass-produced, imported in pairs and are cut to shape are classifiable as orthopedic insoles under heading 9021, HTSUSA, or as parts of footwear heading 6406, HTSUSA.  \u000B\rANALYSIS\r\rClassification under the HTSUSA is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI may then be applied.  \r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, Explanatory Notes (EN), represent the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level (for the 4 digit headings and the 6 digit subheadings) and facilitate classification under the HTSUSA by offering guidance in understanding the scope of the headings and GRI.  The EN, although not dispositive or legally binding, provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS, and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.  See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rIn pertinent part, heading 6406.99.30, HTSUSA, covers “Parts of footwear . . .; removable insoles, heel cushions and similar articles; . . .”  Note 1(e) to chapter 64, HTSUSA, states that \""This Chapter does not cover: Orthopedic footwear or other orthopedic appliances, or parts thereof (heading 9021).\""\r\rAmong other merchandise, heading 9021, HTSUSA, covers “Orthopedic appliances, including crutches...splints and other fracture appliances...other appliances which are worn or carried...to compensate for a defect or disability; parts and accessories thereof.\""  The EN to heading 9021 strictly interpret the provision.  They state that orthopedic appliances are appliances for: \r\r(i) Preventing or correcting bodily deformities; or \r\r(ii) Supporting or holding organs following an illness or operation.  \r\rThey include: \r\r. . .\r\r(6)  Orthopaedic footwear, having an enlarged leather stiffener which may be reinforced with a metal or cork frame, made only to measure.\r\r(7) Special insoles, made to measure.\r\t\r\t. . . \r\rAs the EN state, articles that are properly classified under heading 9021, HTSUSA, are \""made to measure,\"" that is, constructed in accordance with measurements taken on the one intended to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> the article.  Even though the Orthofit 9000 inserts require some fitting by means of applying heat for molding to the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, and are designed so that posts, extensions and covers can be added, they are mass-produced, not “made to measure.”  Additionally, the Orthofit 9000 inserts are imported and sold to physicians in pairs and are available in nine sizes.  Thus, they are not properly classified as orthopedic appliances under heading 9021.  This determination is consistent with past Customs rulings concerning insoles and footwear.  See, Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 956809, dated September 19, 1994 (classifying arch supports as parts of footwear under heading 6404, HTSUSA, because they were not made to measure); HQ 086361, dated May 24, 1990 (classifying insoles and heel pads under heading 6404, HTSUSA, because they were not made to measure); HQ 961556, dated May 10, 1999 (classifying shoes designed to be worn to alleviate <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> discomfort and that were not made to measure, under heading 6404, HTSUSA); and HQ 087508, dated September 27, 1990.\rMoreover, effective January 1, 2002, amendments to the Legal Notes to Chapter 90, HTS, will go into effect.  One of the amendments will replace Note 6 with the following language:\r\rFor the purposes of heading 90.21, the expression “orthopaedic appliances means appliances for:\r\r-\tPreventing or correcting bodily deformities; or\r\r-\tSupporting or holding parts of the body following an illness, operation or injury.\r\rOrthopaedic appliances include footwear and special insoles designed to correct orthopaedic conditions, provided that they are either (1) made to measure or (2) mass-produced, presented singly and not in pairs and designed to fit either <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> equally.\r\rThus, the new Note 6 will allow for the classification of mass-produced orthopedic insoles in heading 9021, HTSUSA.  However, the Orthofit 9000 insoles still will not merit classification under heading 9021, HTSUSA, because they are presented in pairs and are not designed to fit either <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> equally.\r\rBased on the Legal and Explanatory Notes, the Orthofit 9000 insoles are not orthopedic insoles classifiable under heading 9021, HTSUSA.

A sample was submitted.\r\r          FACTS:\r\r               The sample in question is a woman's closed toe, closed back\r          slip-on with an embossed plastic upper, leather trim collar, and\r          leather tassels across the vamp.  The shoe has a 1/2-inch wood\r          wedge, rubber heel, and a leather sole with 14 rubber plugs\r          inserted through holes in the leather.  Each of the rubber plugs\r          is approximately 1/4-inch in diameter and 1/8-inch thick, with\r          about 1/32 of an inch projecting beyond the surface of the\r          leather sole.\r\r          ISSUE:\r\r               Whether the outer sole of the shoe is the rubber plugs or\r          the leather sole.\r\r          LAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r               Subheading 6402.99.30, HTSUSA, provides for footwear with\r          outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics, footwear, of the\r          slip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of\r          fasteners.  Subheading 6405.90.90, HTSUSA, provides for other\r          footwear.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                          -2-\r\r               \""Outer sole\"" is defined, as used in headings 64.01-64.05,\r          HTSUSA, in Chapter 64 of the Harmonized System and Nomenclature\r          Explanatory Notes, General Explanatory Note (c).  It defines the\r          term as meaning, \""that part of the footwear, (other than an\r          attached heel) which, when in use is in contact with the ground.\r          The constituent material of the outer sole for purposes of\r          classification shall be taken to be the material having the\r          greatest surface area in contact with the ground.  In determining\r          the constituent material of the outer sole, no account should be\r          taken of attached accessories or reinforcements such as spikes,\r          bars, nails, protectors or similar attachments which partly cover\r          the sole...\"".\r\r               Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL), 081150, dated November 5,\r          1987, involved a child's slipper consisting of a textile sole\r          with rubber/plastic traction dots.  The rubber dots in this case\r          were approximately 1/8 inch in diameter and less than 1/32-inch\r          thick.  It was decided in this ruling that both the rubber dots\r          and the textile material making up the rest of the sole come in\r          contact with the ground.\r\r               The shoes at issue are similar to the childrens' slippers,\r          however, they have a harder leather sole rather than textile\r          material.  It was shown by putting ink on the leather part of the\r          sole and applying pressure that when weight is put on the shoes\r          in question the leather part of the sole touches the ground.\r          \""When in use\"" the leather part of the sole will touch the ground\r          not only between the dots but also along the front sides and in\r          the toe area where there are no rubber dots, depending on the\r          walking style of the person wearing the shoe.\r\r               This would make the outer sole of the shoe both leather and\r          rubber, classifiable by whichever had the most contact with the\r          ground.  However, the Explanatory Material also stated that no\r          account should be taken of attached accessories or reinforcements\r          such as spikes, protectors or similar attachments which partly\r          cover the sole.  The rubber dots appear to be the type of\r          accessory which is exempt from being included as part of the\r          sole.  They are in the nature of spikes and it would seem that\r          they are meant to protect the wearer from slipping (also the\r          purpose of spikes) as well as to protect the leather from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                          -3-\r\r          HOLDING:\r\r               The outer sole of this shoe is leather.  Therefore this shoe\r          should be classified under subheading 6405.90.90, HTSUSA, as\r          other footwear with duty at the rate of 12.5 percent ad valorem.\r          This classification represents the present position of the\r          Customs Service regarding the dutiable status of the merchandise\r          under the proposed HTSUSA.

"{""text"":""\r\rHQ H257373\rMay 15, 2015\r\rCLA-2 OT: RR: CTF: TCM H257373 ERB\r\rCATEGORY: \tClassification\r\rTARIFF NO.: \t8711.90.00\r\rMr. Michael G. Hodes\rHodes Keating & Pilon\r134 North LaSalle Street, Suite 1300\rChicago, Illinois 60602\r\rRE: \tReconsideration of NY N243337; Classification of an Extreme Off-Road Electric Scooter\r\rDear Mr. Hodes: \r\rThis is in response to your letter dated October 23, 2013, on behalf of your client Dynacraft BSC, Inc. (Dynacraft), requesting the reconsideration of New York Ruling Letter (NY) N243337, issued on July 16, 2013.\u0002 In NY N243337, CBP ruled that an electric scooter was classified in heading 8711, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for motorcycles. You request classification in heading 9503, HTSUS, which provides for tricycles, scooters, pedal cars and similar wheeled toys, and argue that the ruling was issued in error and is not in accord with the current view of CBP. \r\rFACTS: \r\rNY N243337 provides as follows: \r\rIn your letter dated June 20, 2013, you requested a tariff classification. The item under consideration has been identified as an electric dirt bike, model 8801-71, “Avigo Extreme Off-Road Electric Scooter.” The Aviago [sic] is powered by a 36 volt 350 watt electric motor and has a maximum speed of between 18-22 miles per hour, depending on the weight of the rider. In your ruling request you did not provide a maximum rider weight. The applicable subheading for the Avigo Extreme Dirt Bike will be 8711.90.0000, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for Motorcycles (including mopeds) and cycles fitted with an auxiliary motor, with or without side-cars; side-cars: Other. The rate of duty will be Free. \r\rISSUE:\r\rWhether the instant electric scooter is classified as a motorcycle, under heading 8711, HTSUS, or as a wheeled toy, under heading 9503, HTSUS. \rLAW AND ANALYSIS: \r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUS is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI). GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the heading of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes. In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 may then be applied in order. \r\rThe HTSUS provisions at issue are as follows: \r\r8711\tMotorcycles (including mopeds) and cycles fitted with an auxiliary motor, with or without side-cars; side cars: \r***\r\r9503\tTricycles, scooters, pedal cars and similar wheeled toys; dolls’ carriages; dolls, other toys; reduced-scale (“scale”) models and similar recreational models, working or not; puzzles of all kinds; parts and accessories thereof: \r\rNote 1 to Section XVII, which covers chapter 87 states: \r\rThis section does not cover articles of heading 9503…\r\rThus, if an article is found to be classified in heading 9503, HTSUS, it is excluded from classification in Section XVII, specifically, chapter 87. \r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs), constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level. While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the headings. See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). \r\rThe EN 87.11 states: \r\rThis heading covers a group of two-wheeled motorised vehicles which are essentially designed for carrying persons. \r\rIn addition to motorcycles of the conventional type, the heading includes motor-scooters, characterised by their small wheels and by a horizontal platform which joins the front and rear portions of the vehicle; moped, equipped with both a built-in engine and a pedal system; and cycles fitted with an auxiliary motor. \r\rThis heading also covers two-wheeled, electrically-powered transportation devices, designed for carrying a single person, for use within low speed areas such as pavements (sidewalks), paths, and bicycle lanes….\r\rThe EN 95.03 states: \r\rThis heading covers: \r\r(A). Wheeled toys. \r\rThese articles are usually designed for propulsion either by means of pedals, hand levers or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or rod, or, as in the case of certain scooters, by direct pressure of a person’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against the ground. Other types of wheeled toys may be simply drawn or pushed by another person or driven by a motor. \r\rThese toys include: \r\rChildren’s tricycles and the like, but excluding bicycles of heading 87.12.\rTwo- or three-wheeled scooters designed to be ridden by children, as well as youngsters and adults, with an adjustable or non-adjustable steering column and small solid or inflatable wheels. They are sometimes equipped with a bicycle-type handle-bar, a hand brake or a <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> brake on the rear wheel. \r***\r\rAnd it continues: \r\r(D) Other toys. \r\rThis group covers toys intended essentially for the amusement of persons (children or adults)….\r\rIn Streetsurfing LLC v. United States, 11 F. Supp. 3d 1287 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2014) the CIT noted that heading 9503, HTSUS, is a principal use provision. Principal use provisions are governed by Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1, which states in part that, “a classification controlled by use (other than actual use) is to be determined in accordance with the use in the United States, at, or immediately prior to, the date of importation, of goods of that class or kind to which the imported goods belong, and the controlling use is the principal use.” See also HQ H233999, dated March 7, 2013 (classifying a Doodle Buddy). \r\rClassification as a toy under heading 9503, HTSUS, requires that the article be principally used as a toy for amusement and should not serve a utilitarian purpose. See StoreWALL, LLC. v. United States, 644 F.3d 1358, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Toys have been found to include “articles whose principal use is amusement, diversion, or play, rather than practicality.” Processed Plastic Co. v. United States, 473 F.3d 1164, 1169 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting Minnetonka Brands, Inc. v. United States, 24 CIT 645, 110 F. Supp. 2d 1020 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2000). See also HQ H236028, dated December 31, 2013 (classifying an Aquadoodle product as a “toy”). As regards the “wheeled toy” provision of the tariff, the CIT also acknowledged in Streetsurfing LLC v. United States, supra the following: \r\rWhile the court is mindful that in Processed Plastics the Federal Circuit found that “wheeled toys” under HTSUS Heading 9503 must be principally used for amusement, the Explanatory Note accompanying this heading makes clear that the provision is narrower than plaintiff claims. That is, Heading 9503 does not cover every item with wheels that is principally used for amusement…Rather, the Explanatory Notes indicate that, in additional to being principally used for amusement, a wheeled toy properly classifiable under HTSUS Heading 9503 is also characterized by other common features.\r\rId at 1295. Ultimately, the court applied the ENs to the subject waveboards, at issue there, and held that to be considered a “toy,” specifically a “wheeled toy” under heading 9503, the article must be characterized by the following features: (1) the absence of a training requirement prior to its use; (2)  the absence of a meaningful risk of injury involved in its use; (3) the lack of acquired skill to fully utilize the item; (4) the lack of exercise or athletic aspect in the item’s use; and (5) the presence of an assistive device. Streetsurfing LLC v. United States, 11 F. Supp. 3d 1287, 1296-98 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2014).  Thus, whether a product shares the same characteristics as “wheeled toys” of heading 9503, HTSUS, requires a fact-intensive analysis. \r\rThe text of heading 9503, HTSUS, provides for “wheeled toys” which must be “similar” to the precedent exemplars, tricycles, scooters, and pedal cars. See heading 9503, HTSUS. The unifying characteristic of these articles is that they are <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>-powered. But the subject merchandise is not powered by the user’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>. Further, the ENs direct that wheeled toys of 9503, HTSUS, are articles, “usually designed for propulsion either by means of pedals, hand levers or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or rod, or as in the case of certain scooters, by direct pressure of a person’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against the ground.” (Emphasis added). See EN 95.03(A). Yet the subject scooter is powered by a 36 volt 250 watt electric motor. This is not similar to a simple means of propulsion, such as pedals and a chain, or <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>-power. \r\rThe scooter features an electric motor, twist grip throttle, and a handbrake. Riders stand on the platform located between the front and rear wheel. Given the high speed this product is capable of going, the scooter requires coordination of a user’s balance, steering, and propulsion in unison, as well as knowledge and understanding of a hand twist throttle and rear friction brakes. Thus, users require training prior to using the product and acquire a skill in the process. These are two characteristics the CIT stated are absent in “wheeled toys” of heading 9503, HTSUS. \r\rThe electric scooter is capable of going 22 mph. This is considerably faster than toy products at issue in the myriad rulings Dynacraft pointed to as being similar to the subject merchandise. The instruction manual and safety instructions that come with this product are extensive. Dynacraft highly recommends users <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> a helmet, as well as strongly urging parental supervision during use. Specifically, the safety manual states: \r\rThe age grade for the electric dirt bike is for ages 14 and older. Just because someone is within the age and weight limitations specified for the electric dirt bike, does not mean that his/her size is appropriate to fit or maintain control of the electric dirt bike or that he/she is capable of safely operating the electric dirt bike. You are the best judge of whether you or your child is at the appropriate developmental stage for safe use of the electric dirt bike….A parent’s decision to allow their child to use the electric dirt bike should be based on the child’s maturity, skill and their ability to follow rules. \r\rThus, there is a demonstrable risk of injury to users here. It is unclear if the scooter would provide exercise to a user. Certainly it does not provide as much exercise as a scooter propelled by one’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>. Insofar as the scooter has an assistive device by means of its motor, the subject motor is more powerful than motors in wheeled articles which CBP previously classified as “wheeled toys.” See NY N222337, dated July 11, 2012 (classifying an Avigo Electric Scooter which has a 12V rechargeable battery and can go up to 10 mph); see also NY N244196, dated August 14, 2013 (classifying an Avigo 12 Volt Mega Wheel Quad which reaches a maximum speed of 3mph as a “wheeled toy.”). \r\rIn summation, the characteristics of the subject scooters extend well beyond the basic skill or knowledge required for the simple, <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>-powered scooters encompassed by the scope of heading 9503, HTSUS, or the scooters the ENs contemplate. As the CIT noted, all articles listed as wheeled toys are propelled “by means of pedals, hand levers or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or rod, … by direct pressure of a person’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against het ground,” or by “simply [being] drawn or pushed by another person or driven by a motor.” See Streetsurfer LLC, supra, at 1295, citing EN 95.03. Dynacraft reasons that because the off-road electric scooter was designed to amuse teens and young adults in the same manner as the other exemplars in the ENs to 95.03, then it should be classified as a toy. But the subject merchandise differs considerably in size, weight, complexity, and speed from products Avigo claims are similar. Overall, the subject scooters fall outside the scope of a “wheeled toy” pursuant to the framework crafted by the CIT. As such, the exclusionary language in Note 1 to Section XVI does not apply. \r\rA “scooter” is not defined in the tariff, however, the EN to 87.11 are instructive as to what may be classified therein. The EN states that the heading covers a group of two-wheeled motorized vehicles, essentially designed for carrying persons. See EN 87.11. It continues and clarifies that “motor-scooters” are characterized by their small wheels and by a horizontal platform which joins the front and rear portions of the vehicle. It is characterized by its built-in engine or pedal system. Id. Moreover, speed is not a factor to consider in this heading. Scooters which attain any speed may be classified here. Therefore heading 8711, HTSUS, fully describes the subject merchandise because it is a two-wheeled motorized vehicle, designed for carrying persons. \r\rFurther, CBP has consistently classified goods described as such in heading 8711, HTSUS. See NY 876001, dated July 13, 1992 (classifying various motor scooters featuring a primary chain and secondary gear transmission, a centrifugal wet clutch, a 12 volt and 40 watt electrical system, and an electronic CDI ignition, with a maximum speed of 50 km per hour [approximately 31 mph]); NY N008859, dated March 30, 2007 (classifying electric scooters); NY N161585 dated May 6, 2011, (classifying the Razor Ecosmart Metro Electric Scooter, a scooter powered by a 36V (three 12V), batteries which had a maximum speed of 18 mph); and see NY A81574 dated April 15, 1996, (classifying a motorized scooter with a max speed of 15-20 mph requiring a 12V battery, chain drive or belt drive transmission). \r\rHOLDING:\r\rBy application of GRI 1, the subject merchandise is properly classified under heading 8711, HTSUS. It is specifically provided for in subheading 8711.90.00, HTSUS, as “Motorcycles (including mopeds) and cycles fitted with an auxiliary motor; with or without side-cars; side-cars: Other.” The general column one rate of duty is free.

Both styles are slip-on shoes with closed toes and closed heels, cotton uppers, and rubber/plastic outer soles.  Style “Deck Shoes,” #46-T27 also features a foxing-like band that overlaps the upper by more than ¼ inch all around the shoe’s perimeter.  You state that both shoes will be worn in jails by inmates primarily for casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.  Both shoes are valued under $3.00 per pair. \r\r\tThe applicable subheading for style “Kung Fu Shoes,” #K100 will be 6404.19.35, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics and uppers of textile materials, footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, which is 10% or more by weight of rubber or plastics.

As requested, your samples are being returned.\r\rThe first garment, Style CL1315, which you identify as a bicycle shirt, is a men’s pullover garment constructed from 60 percent polyester, 40 percent polyamide, dropped stitch, mesh knit fabric that measures 35 stitches per 2 centimeters counted in the horizontal direction.  Style CL1315 has a self-fabric mock turtleneck; a partial front opening with a zipper closure; short, hemmed sleeves; a rear pouch pocket that extends across the lower back and is divided into three separate compartments; and a tunnel elastic bottom with a curved tail.   \r\r\tThe second garment, Style CL1305, which you identify as a bicycle bib short, is a pair of men’s padded bib shorts that will be constructed of finely knit fabric in either 60 percent polyester, 40 percent polyamide, or 75 percent polyamide, 25 percent elastane.  The one piece pull-on garment has shoulder straps that measure two and one half inches in width; oversized armholes; deeply cut front and rear panels that provide partial covering of the front and back above the waist; and gripper strips at the leg openings.  The garment has a multi-layered thickly padded insert in the crotch and seat area that consists of an outer layer of synthetic chamois with inner layers of foam.  The insert prevents abrasion and chafing and absorbs sweat while biking.  The padded insert is cumbersome, making the garment too restrictive for everyday <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>. \r\rThe third item, no style number stated, is identified as a pair of leg warmers that will be constructed of finely knit fabric in either 60 percent polyester, 40 percent polyamide or 80 percent polyamide, 20 percent elastane.  The leg warmers extend from the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> to above the knee and have self-fabric <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> straps that extend under the instep and gripper strips at the top. \r\rThe fourth and fifth items, Style CL1368, identified as arm warmers, and Style CL1584, identified as knee warmers, cannot be classified without a sample of each item.\r\rThe applicable subheading for Style CL1315 will be 6110.30.3050, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, (HTS), which provides for: sweaters, pullovers, sweatshirts, waistcoats (vests) and similar articles, knitted or crocheted: of man-made fibers: other: other: other: men’s or boys’.

"{""text"":""NY G80670\r\rSeptember 12,  2000\r\r\rCLA-2-64:RR:NC:TP:347 G80670  \r\rCATEGORY:  Classification\r\rTARIFF NO.: 6404.11.90  \r\rMr. William J. Maloney\rRode & Qualey\r295 Madison Avenue\rNew York, NY 10017\r\rRE:\tThe tariff classification of textile footwear from China.\r\rDear Mr. Maloney:\r\r\tIn your letter dated August 17, 2000, written on behalf of your client, Deckers Outdoor Corporation, you requested a tariff classification ruling.\r\r\tYou have submitted samples of what you state are hiking shoes, style names “Quest” in the man’s version and “Cassile” in the woman’s version, made up of mostly textile uppers and rubber outer soles.  You state the shoes possess a foxing-like band since the soles overlap the uppers to a significant extent over virtually the entire perimeter of the upper.  Both shoes are valued over $12.00 per pair.  \r\r\tYour inquiry concerns whether or not this type of shoe is considered “tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like” as defined in Additional U.S. Note 2, Chapter 64, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS).  You state that these shoes are not like athletic footwear and should be classified as hiking shoes.\r\r\tYou state that, although bearing a limited resemblance to certain types of athletic footwear, the subject footwear’s outer sole is significantly heavier and stiffer than would be found on athletic footwear.  You state the shoes are designed for hiking and are not designed to be used for running or other athletic contests involving fast footwork.  You also state that the footwear incorporates a molded nylon heel cup or stabilizer which will protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> during hiking activity, also the relatively heavy and stiff sole incorporates a deep lug pattern for added traction.\r\r\tAdditional U.S. Note 2, Chapter 64 (HTS), defines the term “tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like” as athletic footwear other than sports footwear (as defined in subheading note 1 to Chapter 64 (HTS)), whether or not principally used for such athletic games or purposes.  \r\r\tIn HQ 953882 dated September 24, 1993, Customs rejected the contention that certain hiking boots are classifiable as athletic footwear, citing certain conspicuous differences between hiking boots and athletic footwear and the like.  Specifically, the hikers featured:\r\ra “heel” stabilizer on the “in” side of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> which extends past the mid point of the shoe;\r\rStitched and cemented on, molded rubber heel and toe bumpers;\r\r\rOutersoles which are considerably heavier and stiffer (although substantially less so than the usual hiker) and which have a quite different design and spacing for the “studs”; and\r\rUppers which cover the ankle.\r\r\r\tIn HQ 955224 dated March 25, 1994, Customs agreed that certain off-road protective footwear qualified as “athletic footwear.”  Among the reasons presented supporting classification as “athletic footwear” was:\r\rThe footwear is constructed along the same general lines as athletic footwear.  The only real difference is the outersole which is somewhat heavier than some, but not all, jogging shoes.  It is no less flexible.\r\rThe footwear is light; it is not heavier than athletic footwear.  It is consistent with the weight of athletic footwear.\r\rThe footwear is designed for use in activities which require fast footwork and extensive running. \r\r Aside from the physical appearance, the identification of basketball shoes, tennis shoes, (i.e. court shoes), gym shoes and training shoes is generally dependent upon (but not limited to), the presence of certain construction features incorporated into the shoes.  These features include special arch supports, shock absorbers, lateral stabilizers and special traction soles, features that are evident in the “Quest” and “Cassile” shoes.  The only characteristics consistently evident in the cited rulings which differentiate “athletic” from other types of footwear in addition to materials and appearance, is the weight of the shoes and the flexibility of the outer soles enabling the wearer to participate in activities requiring fast footwork and running.  Styles “Quest” and “Cassile” are certainly lightweight and flexible enough to be used in athletic activities, whether or not they are principally used for such athletic games or purposes.  They are constructed along the same general lines as athletic shoes, secured by a lace-tie closure and rubber/plastic outer soles which overlap the upper and forms a foxing-like band similar to those found on many athletic shoes.  This type of sole provides the necessary traction and stability to participate competitively in athletic endeavors.  These shoes are not unusual for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> while participating in athletic activities.  In addition, the literature provided emphasizes the shoe’s dependable long <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and describes them as being lightweight. \r\r\tThe applicable subheading for styles “Quest” and “Cassile” will be 6404.11.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics and uppers of textile materials, which are athletic, having a foxing or foxing-like band applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper, valued over $12.00 per pair.  The rate of duty will be 20% ad valorem.   \r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

Also, there is a 3 inch diameter leather patch with rows of raised rubber traction darts, sewn on at the back of the heel.  The shoe has a predominately textile upper, with a stitched-on, 3/4 inch wide leather topline collar that incorporates four pairs of metal eyelets spaced around it to contain a functional leather lace, which, after being laced around the topline, passes through a single pair of metal eyelets on leather tabs across the wearers instep.  The lace allows for the tightening of the shoe on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  You state that the lace is \""functional\"".  We take it that more often than not, the lace will be tied and untied by the wearer.\r\r     You state in your letter that this item will be valued at  more than $12.00 per pair.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for this shoe will be 6404.19.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear, in which the upper's external surface is predominately textile materials; in which the outer sole's external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not \""athletic\"" footwear; in which the upper's external surface is still 50% or less leather even after every leather accessory or reinforcement present is included as part of the upper's external surface; which is not designed to be a protection against water, oil, or cold or inclement weather; which has neither open toes nor open heels and is not a slip-on; and which is valued, we presume, over $12.00 per pair.

We presume the\r\""Grass Chaps\"", a sample of which was not provided, does not\rdiffer much (except possibly in size and/or styling features)\rfrom your \""Lawn Chaps\"" sample.   We believe this is so, since the\rbreakdown by value figures, which you do provide for both\rsamples, show only a slightly cheaper value for the textile\rcomponent of the \""Grass Chap\"", while remaining equal for all\rother components present.\r\r     The articles in question are designed to be worn by persons\rengaged in residential lawn care and to provide the wearer with\rprotection against flying debris and other accidents which might\roccur while working with lawn care equipment.   They provide\rprotection for the lower leg (shin) and ankle as well as the\rupper portion of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.   Both the \""Lawn Chaps\"" and \""Grass\rChaps\"" are constructed of man-made textile materials, either\rpolyester or nylon, and contain special high strength\r\""polycarbonate\"" plastic inserts, which are permanently sewn into\rthe articles and provide additional protection to the wearer.  \rBoth these items are attached to the leg with straps and buckles\rand may be worn over long pants or on bare legs with shorts.\r\r     It is our determination that each of the two items described\rabove constitutes a composite good and that each consists of both\ra textile and a plastic insert component.   Based on the\rsubmitted component value breakdown figures, which indicate that\rthe plastic \""insert\"" cost $1.53 compared with $1.04 for the nylon\rfabric or $0.92 for the polyester fabric in the \""Lawn Chaps\""\rlegging <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> ($1.53 for the plastic \""insert\"", $0.75 for the nylon\rfabric or $0.63 for the polyester fabric in the \""Grass Chaps\"")\rand on the primary purpose of wearing these items to provide\rimpact protection against flying debris, also mostly attributable\rto the plastic \""insert\"", we are of the opinion that the essential\rcharacter of both these items is not imparted by their textile\rcomponents.   \r\r     The applicable subheading for both the \""Lawn Chaps\"" and the\r\""Grass Chaps\"" leg <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> articles will be 6406.99.3060, Harmonized\rTariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for\rgaiters, leggings and similar articles, and parts thereof, which\rare not essentially of textile materials or wood, but which are\rof rubber and/or plastics relative to other materials.

You have submitted a sample of style 69142.  You state that the outer surface is composed of 87% polyester and 13% nylon terry cloth fabric.  The booties will be imported with a removable textile packet filled with 300 grams of buckwheat seed and 5 grams of lavender.  The packet can be heated and then inserted in a pocket located on the back of the bootie.  The booties are then placed over the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> to provide warmth and aromatherapy.  You opine that the item is excluded from heading 6405 Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), because Note 1(b) to Chapter 64 states that “this chapter does not cover footwear of textile material, without an outer sole glued, sewn or otherwise affixed or applied to the upper.\r\t\r\tThe submitted sample is a textile slipper that covers the ankle consisting of sewn together textile components, (i.e. upper panels and a separate textile panel on the walking surface).  The slipper has an elasticized component in the collar that keep it on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Generally, in order for an item to be classified as footwear in Chapter 64, it must have an outer sole that is a separate, identifiable component prior to its application to the upper.  In addition, the sole component must encompass the entire underfoot area and the complete article must not be designed for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> inside other footwear.  In this regard, Item 69142 satisfies these requirements for footwear classified in Chapter 64 (HTSUS). The textile slipper and the removable packet (including its contents) is a composite good, with the essential character imparted by the slipper.\r\rThe applicable subheading for “Super Soft Holiday Heated Booties.” style number 69142 will be 6405.20.90, which provides for other footwear with uppers of textile material, other.

Therefore, if imported as is, it will not meet the country of origin marking requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1304.  Accordingly, the footwear would be considered not legally marked under the provisions of 19 C.F.R. 134.11 which states, \""every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit, in such manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the U.S. the English name of the country of origin of the article.\""\r\rThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

Most imported goods are classified\rby application of GRI 1, that is, according to the terms of the\rheadings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter\rnotes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on\rthe basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not\rotherwise require, the remaining GRI's may then be applied.  The\rExplanatory Notes (EN's) to the Harmonized Commodity Description\rand Coding System, which represent the official interpretation of\rthe tariff at the international level, facilitate classification\runder the HTSUSA by offering guidance in understanding the scope\rof the headings and GRI's.\r    \r    Heading 9505 provides for, inter alia, festive, carnival and\rother entertainment articles.  The EN's to 9505 indicate that the\rheading covers:\r\r\r                               -3-\r\r          (A) Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles,\r          which in view of their intended use are generally \r          made of non-durable material.  They include:\r\r               (1) Decorations such as festoons, garlands,       \r               Chinese lanterns, etc., as well as various        \r               decorative articles made of paper, metal foil,    \r               glass fibre, etc., for Christmas trees (e.g.,     \r               tinsel, stars, icicles), artificial snow, coloured\r               balls, bells, lanterns, etc.  Cake and other      \r               decorations (e.g., animals, flags) which          \r               are traditionally associated with a particular    \r               festival are also classified here.\r\r               (2) Articles traditionally used at Christmas\r               festivities, e.g., artificial Christmas trees     \r               (these are sometimes of the folding type),        \r               nativity scenes, Christmas crackers, Christmas    \r               stockings, imitation yule logs....\r\r                             *  *  *\r\r     In general, merchandise is classifiable in heading 9505,\rHTSUSA, as a festive article when the article, as a whole:\r\r     1.   is of non-durable material or, generally, is not\r          purchased because of its extreme worth, or intrinsic   \r          value (e.g., paper, cardboard, metal foil, glass fiber,\r          plastic, wood);\r\r     2.   functions primarily as a decoration (e.g., its primary\r          function is not utilitarian); and\r\r     3.   is traditionally associated or used with a particular\r          festival (e.g., stockings and tree ornaments for       \r          Christmas, decorative eggs for Easter).\r\r     An article's satisfaction of these three criteria is\rindicative of classification as a festive article.  The motif of\ran article is not dispositive of its classification and,\rconsequently, does not transform an item into a festive article.\r     \r     First, the articles are made of non-durable material.  Customs\rwill consider these articles, of artificial foliage, to be made of\rnon-durable material since they are not designed for sustained <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>\rand tear, nor are purchased because of their extreme worth or value\r(as would be the case with a decorative, yet costly, piece of art\ror crystal).\r\r\r\r                               -4-\r\r     Next, the articles' primary function is decorative, as opposed\rto, utilitarian.  It is apparent, they serve no useful function\rbesides their role as decoration.\r\r     Finally, when examining the trees, wreaths, and garlands, as\ra whole, it is evident that the articles are traditionally\rassociated or used with the particular festival of Christmas. \rArtificial Christmas trees are cited in the EN's to 9505, as\rexemplars of traditional, festive articles.  Furthermore, in\rHeadquarters' Ruling Letter (HRL) 950999, issued April 16, 1992,\rvarious wreaths and garlands, with artificial foliage, were\rclassified in 9505.10.40 as festive articles for Christmas\rfestivities.  Following is the language from HRL 950999 wherein\rCustoms explained which types of garlands, wreaths, etc. would be\rclassifiable in 9505.10 as festive articles for Christmas\rfestivities.\r     \r          Those artificial foliage items which qualify as        \r          Christmas articles of subheading 9505.10 include       \r          wreaths, garlands, candle rings, centerpieces --       \r          complete articles -- made up of foliage commonly \r          and traditionally associated with Christmas [i.e.,\r          artificial poinsettias, pine cones, pine needle \r          leaves, evergreen branches, holly berries, holly       \r          leaves, laurel leaves, or mistletoe (singly or         \r          combination thereof)].  (This largely restates \r          Customs position under the TSUS).  These articles \r          can be further decorated with plastic sleighs,         \r          miniature Santas, glass balls, ribbon, etc.            \r          Stylized/modern versions of Christmas wreaths,         \r          garlands, etc. (i.e., those articles decorated with    \r          neon poinsettias, mauve glass balls, etc.) also \r          qualify as festive.\r\r          At the present time, based on the information before   \r          us, there is no other artificial foliage traditionally\r          associated with any other holiday.  Hence, only\r          Christmas foliage of the type described above is       \r          classifiable in heading 9505.

Almost all that is visible covering the\rwearer's <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> when worn, laces and tongue excluded, are the top\rpart of the rubber sidewalls of the simultaneous molded bottom,\rand several substantial areas of nylon mesh and plastic coated\rleather.  The exposed nylon mesh is not part of a complete upper\rof nylon mesh, which is the norm in similar shoes, but several\rpatches of an unusually thin mesh cemented to a sturdy fabric \rwith a relatively fuzzy, napped surface.  The nylon fabric here\rthus seems to serve a simply decorative purpose.  The leather\rpieces are all stitched to this same fuzzy fabric.  The fuzzy\rfabric has its own lining inside it, covers the entire <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, is\rstitched to the underfoot in these slip-lasted constructed shoes,\rand is clearly the only possible base material of the \""upper\"".  \rAlthough it is an unusual upper since fuzziness is not the norm\rin the aesthetics of athletic footwear uppers and since none of\rits surface is visible in the finished shoe, we believe it must\rbe the \""upper\"" by the process of elimination so we consider the\rrubber sidewalls, the cemented-on nylon mesh, and the leather\rpieces all to be \""accessories or reinforcements\"". \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     We note that the \""Made in Indonesia\"" is on the part of the\rsewn in label which leaves it right at the sock line,in fact the\rlast two letters of \""Indonesia\"" are covered up by the removable\rinsole in one of the samples, and it is about two inches further\rforward inside the shoe compared to the top edge of the tongue.\rEven though this label also has the USA, JPN, EUR, UK shoe sizes,\rwhich is a general indication that the label is in a reasonably\r\""conspicuous\"" location, it is clear that the \""Made in Indonesia\""\rhere is not in a location which is as conspicuous as the nature\rof the article will allow.  Therefore, if imported as is, Customs \rshould refuse delivery of these shoes into USA commerce until\rremarked in a more conspicuous location, e.g., on the inside of\rthe top of the tongue.   \r\r     The applicable subheading for this style will be 6404.11.20,\rHarmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which\rprovides for  footwear, in which the upper's external surface is\rpredominately textile materials (Note that an accessory or\rreinforcement on top of another material is not part of the\rupper's external surface, but the material hidden underneath is);\rin which the outer sole's  external surface is predominately\rrubber and/or plastics; which is either \""sports footwear\"" or\rtennis, basketball, gym, or training shoes or the like; and in\rwhich the upper's external surface area is over 50% leather after\revery leather accessory and reinforcement  present is included as\rpart of the upper's external surface.

US, Inc., on June 22,\r1995, against your decision regarding the classification of\rwomen's espadrille shoes.  All entries were liquidated on March\r24, 1995.  Only samples of one of the subject styles, \""Carmen\"",\rwere provided to this office for examination.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The merchandise consists of two styles of women's espadrille\rshoes.  The first style, referenced style name \""Carmen\"", consists\rof a textile upper which features a closed toe and heel, a thick\rjute platform midsole and a rubber outer sole.  Two samples of\rthis style were submitted to this office, one style features a\rshort lace, and the second style features a much longer lace. \rThe shoe has ten metal eyelet holes situated near the top edges\rof the upper, which are spaced in a symmetrical pattern around\rthe circumference of the topline opening.  A 5/8 inch wide flat\rtextile lace is laced into the eyelets.  On the style with the\rlonger lace, after exiting the last pair of eyelets the ends are\rstill sufficiently long so that they can be wrapped and securely\rtied around the wearer's ankle.\r\r     The second style, referenced style name \""Lucy\"", is composed\rof a textile upper which features an open heel, a thick jute\rplatform midsole and a rubber outer sole.\r\r\r     The Protestant claims that style Carmen was improperly\rclassified by Customs in subheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: other:\rvalued over $6.50 but not over $12/pair.  The Protestant argues\rthat this classification is incorrect because the rubber on the\router sole merely serves as reinforcement to the jute midsole and\rthe lace strap serves only as an ornamental feature.  The\rProtestant further adds that when style Carmen was analyzed by\rthe independent laboratory, it measured only 8.8 percent by\rweight of rubber or plastic. \r\r     Similarly, the Protestant claims that style Lucy was\rimproperly classified by Customs in subheading 6404.19.35,\rHTSUSA, which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber,\rplastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile\rmaterials: footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics:\rother: footwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the\rslip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces\ror buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing except footwear of\rsubheading 6404.19.20 and except footwear having a foxing or\rfoxing-like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics\rapplied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper: other. \rThe Protestant argues that this classification is incorrect\rbecause when analyzed by an independent laboratory, the shoe\rmeasured only 9.9 percent by weight of rubber or plastic.  \r\r     Accordingly, the Protestant claims that both style Carmen\rand Lucy should be classified in subheading 6405.20.90, HTSUSA,\rwhich provides for other footwear: with uppers of textile\rmaterials: other.  In the alternative, classification is proposed\rin subheading 6404.19.30, HTSUSA, which provides for footwear\rwith outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition\rleather and uppers of textile materials: footwear with outer\rsoles of rubber or plastics: other: footwear with open toes or\ropen heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, the\rforegoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except\rfootwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or almost\rwholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and\roverlapping the upper: less than 10 percent by weight of rubber\ror plastics: other.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     What is the proper classification of the merchandise at\rissue?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff\rSchedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is in accordance\rwith the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 requires\rthat classification be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes.  Where goods\rcannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, the remaining\rGRI will be applied, in the order of their appearance.\r\r\r     Classification of goods under chapter 64, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for footwear, is determined by the materials that\rcomprise the outer soles and uppers.  Note 4(b) to that chapter\rprovides that:\r\r     The constituent material of the outer sole shall be taken to\r     be the material having the greatest surface area in contact\r     with the ground, no account being taken of accessories or\r     reinforcements such as spikes, bars, nails, protectors or\r     similar attachments.\r\r     The Protestant claims that both shoe styles have a jute\router sole merely reinforced with a layer of rubber; the rubber\rserves to \""reinforce the jute outer sole primarily at the toe,\rheel, and along its perimeter\"".  As further evidence that the\rrubber serves merely as reinforcement, the Protestant adds that\rwhen the identical merchandise is sold without the rubber\rreinforcement, exposing the jute outer sole, the subject footwear\ris considered to have outer soles of textile in accordance with\rNote 4(b).\r\r     Although Note 4(b) does provide as an exception to the outer\rsole having the greatest contact with the ground, any\r\""accessories or attachments\"", it similarly defines those terms. \rThe words \""accessories\"" and \""reinforcements\"" are followed by a\rlimited number of defining exemplars such as spikes, bars, nails,\rprotectors or similar attachments.  To conclude that by\rsimilitude an entire external surface layer of rubber soling is\rincluded within the meaning of \""similar attachments\"" is not only\runfounded but clearly contradicts the intended meaning of Note\r4(b).  Following the above cited chapter note, it is apparent\rthat rubber is the constituent material of the outer sole having\rthe greatest surface area in contact with the ground.  Although\rthere are several \""cut outs\"" where the jute is exposed, the jute\ris sunken relative to the rubber outer sole so that more rubber\rwill have contact with the ground.  See also HQ 088334 dated\rMarch 12, 1991.  Furthermore, to add that identical merchandise\rsold without the rubber reinforcement is considered to have outer\rsoles of textile gives further support to our position that the\rsubject merchandise has rubber outer soles.  Merchandise is\rclassified by Customs on a case by case basis.  Shoes such as\rthese, without rubber outer soles and which expose the existing\rjute midsoles would naturally be classified based on the textile\rmidsoles, which in this case would serve as outer soles.  Customs\rhas consistently classified this type of espadrille shoe with a\rjute platform midsole and a heat molded-on rubber <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> surface\rbottom as footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics.  See\re.g., HQ 953483, dated July 29, 1993.  As such, it is our opinion\rthat the subject merchandise has an outer sole of rubber.\r\r     Protestant also claims that the textile fashion lace or\rstrap on style Carmen merely serves as an ornamental fashion\rfeature which does not hold the shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer. \rIn support of this claim reference is made to HQ 073384, dated\rDecember 22, 1983 and HQ 801649, dated November 24, 1981.  In HQ\r073384, discussing a women's imitation moccasin style casual\rshoe, Customs determined that the sample shoe was of the slip-on\rtype because:\r\r\r\r     the lace is not a functional fastener noting that it is sewn\rdown where it passes through  both the plug and the collar. \r                              Moreover, we would call this a\r                              slip-on even if the lace were not\r                              sewn down because wearers of this\r                              type of footwear normally tie the\r                              lace once to fit the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, and then\r                              slip the shoe on and off without\r                              retying the lace.\r\r     Unlike the submitted shoe, the shoe of HQ 073384 featured a\rnon-functioning lace which had been sewn down where it passes\rthrough the collar and the eyelets in the plug.  Notwithstanding,\rthe shoe in question in HQ 073384 was not like the subject\respadrille shoe which encases the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> with a soft textile upper\rbut a more rigid moccasin style shoe.  Thus, the lace strap on\rthe moccasin could easily be tied once to fit the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> allowing\rthe moccasin to be slipped on and off without further use of the\rlace strap. The same could not be said for the subject\respadrille.  The lace strap functions to conform the shoe snugly\rto the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer.  Once this is done, although it might\rbe possible to slip the shoe off, it would be more difficult to\rslip it back on without the textile upper folding into itself\rwhen the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> enters the shoe.\r\r     In HQ 801649, discussing a canvas, mock toe, rolled sole\rwoman's casual shoe, Customs determined that the sample shoe was\rof the slip-on type because:\r\r     The lace can be tied and untied and by pulling on the lace\r     ends through the kiltie and by tightly tying them together\r     (to keep the kiltie from returning to its usual position)\r     the shoe can be made somewhat tighter around the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>. \r     However, the effect is limited and rather awkward so we\r     believe this will rarely be done, almost certainly not each\r     time the shoe is worn.  Therefore, despite the lace, we\r     consider this a slip-on shoe.\r     \r     Although the shoe of HQ 801649 has a lace strap which allows\rthe ends to be tied together to make the shoe tighter around the\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, the ruling states that its effects are limited and awkward. \rTherefore, the presumption is that this unnecessary task will be\roften, if not always, skipped when putting on the shoe. As was\rdiscussed above, the design of the subject shoe does not\rfacilitate this option.  The subject espadrille features a lace\rstrap which is not only functional, but would render the ability\rto put on the shoe difficult without the use of the lace strap. \rThe shoe would easily collapse under the weight of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of\rthe wearer if the lace ends were not consistently readjusted\revery time the shoe was worn, regardless of their length.  Thus,\ralthough the long lace may have been designed to be wrapped\raround the ankle merely for its ornamental appeal, the design of\rthe shoe requires that the lace be passed around the wearer's\rankle and tied to hold the shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Additionally, it\rshould be noted that contrary to the Protestant's assertion that\rthe shoe stays securely on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> even without the use of the\rlace strap, when the submitted shoe was worn by someone in this\roffice without the use of the lace strap, the shoe slipped off\rthe wearer's <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Accordingly, as it is our position that the\rsubmitted sample is not of the slip-on type and that it has a\rrubber/plastic outer sole, the shoe does not qualify for\rclassification within subheadings 6404.19.25 through 6404.19.35,\rHTSUSA, where the breakdown of percentage by weight of\rrubber/plastic is of relevance.\r\r\r     In regard to percentage by weight of rubber/plastic for\rstyle Lucy, the Protestant disputes the findings of the Customs\rlaboratory which determined style Lucy  to be 10.2 percent by\rweight of rubber/plastic.  The Protestant submitted a report\rprepared by an independent laboratory which determined style Lucy\rto be 9.9 percent by weight of rubber/plastic.  The fact that an\rindependent laboratory determined a different result from that of\rthe Customs laboratory does not change Custom's decision.  The\rfindings of the Customs laboratory will take priority over an\rindependent laboratory result.\r\r     As such, the subject espadrille shoes, referenced style\rnames \""Carmen\"" and \""Lucy\"", were correctly classified in\rsubheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA, and subheading 6404.19.35, HTSUSA,\rrespectively.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     Style name \""Carmen\"" is classified in subheading 6404.19.80,\rHTSUSA, which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber,\rplastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile\rmaterials: footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics:\rother: other: valued over $6.50 but not over $12/pair.  The\rapplicable rate of duty is 90 cents/pr. plus 20 percent ad\rvalorem.\r\r     Style name \""Lucy\"" is classified in subheading 6404.19.35,\rHTSUSA, which provides for\rfootwear with outer soles or rubber, plastics, leather or\rcomposition leather and uppers of textile materials: footwear\rwith outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: footwear with open\rtoes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to\rthe <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners,\rthe foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except\rfootwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or almost\rwholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and\roverlapping the upper: other.  The applicable rate of duty is\r37.5 percent ad valorem.\r\r     The protest should be denied in full and a copy of this\rruling should be appended to the CF 19 Notice of Action to\rsatisfy the notice requirement of section 174.30(a) Customs\rRegulations.\r\r     In accordance with Section 3(A)(11)(b) of Customs Directive\r099 3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject: Revised Protest\rDirective, this decision should be mailed by your office to the\rProtestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter. \rAny reliquidation of the entry in accordance with the decision\rmust be accomplished prior to mailing of the decision.

This sandal-type shoe consists of a molded rubber cupsole shell bottom component part with closed rubber toe and heel areas, which also includes a removable insole.  The rubber cupsole bottom portion also has 1-¼ inch high sidewalls and a separately attached rubber/plastic outer sole.  The unique feature of this unisex shoe is that it has an injection molded midsole with four separate 2-inch wide slotted openings cut out of it along its horizontal length.  Through these openings, an elasticized 2-inch wide textile strap is threaded and then wound around the sides and the top of the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The wrap-around textile strapping, which overlaps itself and has strategically placed hook-and-loop fastenings, is the feature that not only secures the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> into the rubber/plastic cupsole bottom, but also becomes the shoe’s predominant external surface upper material.  After the initial fitting and snug tightening of the elasticized textile strap upper to fit the wearer, as per a provided instruction sheet, the shoe is complete.  It can be taken off and put back on by simply loosening the bandage-like strap upper.  We note that you have informed this office by telephone that this item will be valued at over $12.00 per pair.\r\r\tThe applicable subheading for this shoe, identified as a “Men’s/Women’s Footwear Kit”, will be 6404.19.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear, in which the upper’s external surface is predominately textile materials; in which the outer sole’s external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not “athletic” footwear; which is not designed to be a protection against water, oil or cold or inclement weather; which does not have open toes or open heels; which is not a slip-on; and which, we presume, is valued over $12.00 per pair.

Box 68\rFairhaven, MA   02719\r\rRE: Tariff Classification of “Chafer Gear”\r\rDear Mr. Browne:\r\rThis letter concerns your request for a ruling involving the tariff classification of  “Chafer Gear”under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA).\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe product is an eight-<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> long, loosely-twisted group of polyethylene or polypropylene monofilaments with an estimated twist of approximately 3 to 4 turns per meter.  The product has a loose, rope-like appearance and is approximately 1 ½ inches in diameter.  The filaments are crudely secured at the center of the group with a piece of black plastic tape. \t\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper tariff classification of the product, identified as “chafer gear,” under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\fClassification of merchandise under the HTSUSA, is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI’s) and in accordance with the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI’s may then be applied.  The Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (EN’s), which represent the official interpretation of the tariff at the international level, facilitate classification under the HTSUSA by offering guidance in understanding the scope of the headings and GRI’s.\r\rAccording to your description, the product, is used to attach to fishing nets to reduce the abrasion when the net is being used. The federal regulations that govern ground fish trawl under the Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 50 CFR Part 663.2(c), \""chafing gear\"" is defined as \""webbing or other material attached to the bottom (underside) or around the codend of a trawl net to protect the codend from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.\""\r\r  Clearly, this product has been designed to provide protection to the net and is used in the fishing industry  for that purpose.  The word “chafer” is defined in Webster’s 3rd New International Dictionary as \""a strip of fabric covering the head of a tire as a protection from chafing against the rim.\""  In the subject case, once the loosely twisted  rope has unraveled, it forms a fabric-like covering comprised of textile filament strands which protect the codend of the net from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> or \""chafing.\""\r\rIt is our understanding that this product is to be used in its imported condition, that is, pre-cut eight <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths which are attached to fishing nets to reduce abrasion.

All of the items are designed to be worn for the claimed benefits of compression to the joints, stabilization, and relief from pain and swelling. Each of these compression items is composed of 80% polyamide, 14% elastane and 6% polyester knit fabric.  Each item is unisex and will be available in various sizes. \r\rThe first three samples cover the upper ankle area to just below the arch area.  The toes are completely open.  \r\rStyle #K602834000 protect.Leva strap, supports joint function with an adjustable strap that crisscrosses over the top of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.

We received two samples from you.\r\u000BFACTS:  \r\rYou describe the subject merchandise, item 08498, the Piggie Play <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Rattle, as tiny rattle/squeaker socks for infants ages birth and up. The merchandise is made of polyester pique knit fabric.  You state the merchandise is designed for infants to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> on their feet in a “playing environment”.  Each sock has piggy heads with a rattle and squeaker inside of each piggy head.  You state the squeaker and rattle helps the infant discover the wonders of playing with his/her tiny toes and listening to the sounds of the rattle and squeaker as the infant moves and kicks his/her feet.  You also state the merchandise has a play feature within as the socks are designed to have little piggy heads and numbers so the parent can play “This little piggy” and count the infant’s toes as they play along.\r\rISSUE:\t\r\r\tWhat is the classification of the subject merchandise?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tMerchandise is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.  When goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1 and if the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes do not require otherwise, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 may be applied. \r\r\tAdditionally, the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) are the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS.  See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed.

Accordingly, we incorporate the LAW AND ANALYSIS section of these rulings in this decision.  Please find enclosed a copy of the final Notice of Modification, dated January 4, 2006, which contains the two referenced rulings.  \r\r\tTherefore, the merchandise at issue is classified within subheading 6111.30.5050, HTSUSA, which provides for “Babies’ garments and clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted:  Of synthetic fibers:  Other…Other:  Babies’ socks and booties.” \r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tThe Piggie Play <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Rattle, item 08498, is classifiable in subheading 6111.30.5050, HTSUSA, which provides for “Babies’ garments and clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted:  Of synthetic fibers:  Other…Other:  Babies’ socks and booties.”  The general column one duty rate is 16 percent.  The applicable textile quota category is 239.\r\rQuota/visa requirements are no longer applicable for merchandise which is the product of a World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries.  The textile category number above applies to merchandise produced in non-WTO member-countries.

Davies\rTower Group International, Inc.\rP.O. Box 19169\rCharlotte, North Carolina  28217-9169\r\rRE: Tariff Classification of “Chafing Yarn”\r\rDear Mr. Davies:\r\rThis letter concerns your request for a ruling involving the tariff classification of  “Chafing Yarn”under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA).\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe subject article is described as “chafing yarn” for use as chafing gear on trawl nets.  \rThe “yarn” is composed of approximately thirty polyethylene monofilaments, which are twisted together to form a twisted cord which is approximately 3 millimeters in diameter.  Approximately sixty of these cords are then twisted together to form the “chafing yarn” in its imported condition.  Its overall appearance is a long, loosely twisted rope made of individual cords, the overall diameter of the rope being approximately 1 inch.  The overall decitex of each of the sixty strands would be about 29,328.   The material is imported in 600-foot lengths.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper tariff classification of the product, identified as “chafing yarn,” under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\fClassification of merchandise under the HTSUSA, is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI’s) and in accordance with the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRI’s may then be applied.  The Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (EN’s), which represent the official interpretation of the tariff at the international level, facilitate classification under the HTSUSA by offering guidance in understanding the scope of the headings and GRI’s.\r\rIt is our understanding that this product is imported in 600 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths.  The 1-inch diameter rope is cut into nine to ten <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths so that it may be tied onto the end of fishing nets.\rWith regard to its technical use, the federal regulations that govern ground fish trawl under the Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 50 CFR Part 663.2(c), \""chafing gear\"" is defined as \""webbing or other material attached to the bottom (underside) or around the codend of a trawl net to protect the codend from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>.\""\r\r  Clearly, this product has been designed to provide protection to the net and is used in the fishing industry  for that purpose.  The word “chafer” is defined in Webster’s 3rd New International Dictionary as \""a strip of fabric covering the head of a tire as a protection from chafing against the rim.\""  In the subject case, once the loosely twisted  rope has unraveled, it forms a fabric-like covering comprised of textile filament strands which protect the codend of the net from <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> or \""chafing.\""\r\rAlthough heading 5608 of the HTSUSA, covers \""Knotted netting of twine, cordage or rope; made up fishing nets and other made up nets, of textile materials,\"" there is no break-out provision for \""parts of nets\"" under this heading.  Even if there were such a provision, the product is imported in 600 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths and must be cut into nine to ten <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths in order to be attached as \""parts of nets.\""  We must classify this product pursuant to the condition in which it is imported, i.e., 600 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> lengths.  Thus, it is our determination that the subject \""chafing yarn\"" is classifiable pursuant to GRI 1 because it is most specifically described  under subheading 5607.49.2500, HTSUSA, as \""Twine, cordage, ropes and cables, whether or not plaited or braided and whether or not impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber or plastics.\"" \r\rThis product is described as being made of “ high density polyethylene monofialment- twisted together to form a single strand, neither braided nor plated.”  As we have already noted, 5607, HTSUSA, clearly indicates that the heading includes ropes even if they have not been plaited or braided.  The fact that this heading is intended to cover this type of loosely twisted rope is further reinforced by  the EN’s for heading 5607 which specifically states that ropes which have been produced by twisting are covered under this heading.  Specifically, the EN states that heading 5607 \""covers twine, cordage, ropes and cables, produced by twisting or by plaiting or braiding (emphasis supplied).\""\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\fThe product identified as \""chafing yarn\"" is classifiable under subheading 5607.49.2500, HTSUSA, as \""Twine, cordage, ropes and cables, whether or not plaited or braided and whether or not impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber or plastics: Of polyethylene or polypropylene:  Other: Other, not braided or plaited: Other.\""   This provision is dutiable at the general column one rate of 24 cents/kilogram plus 14.2 percent ad valorem.  The textile restraint category is 201.\r\rThe designated textile and apparel category may  be subdivided into parts.  If so, visa and quota requirements applicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since part categories are the result of international bilateral agreements which are subject to frequent negotiations and changes, to obtain the most current information available, we suggest that you check, close to the time of shipment, the Status Report On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels), an issuance of the U.S. Customs Service, which is updated weekly and is available at your local Customs office.\r\rDue to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation (the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the restraint (quota/visa) categories, you should contact your local Customs office prior to importing the merchandise to determine the current status of any import restraints or requirements.\r\rSincerely,\r\rJohn Durant, Director\rTariff Classification Appeals Division\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1996/959802.doc"",""id"":13861,""rulingNumber"":""959802"",""subject"":""Tariff Classification of “Chafing Yarn”"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1996-12-24T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""5607.49.2500""]}"

Hjelm\rAkin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP\r1333 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W.\rWashington, DC 20036-1564\r\rRE:\tRevocation of New York Ruling Letter N239002, dated March 29, 2013; tariff classification of the Nike Studio Wrap Pack\r\rDear Mr. Hjelm:\r\r\tThis letter is to inform you that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has reconsidered New York Ruling Letter (NY) N239002, issued to your client, Nike USA, Inc. (“Nike”) on March 29, 2013, concerning the tariff classification of a collection of footwear articles contained in Nike’s “Studio Wrap Pack” (Item #324734). In ruling letter NY N239002, CBP determined that the Studio Wrap Pack was not classifiable as “goods put up in sets for retail sale,” pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 3(b), and concluded that the component articles of the Studio Wrap Pack should be separately classified, pursuant to GRI 1, in their respective headings.  Upon your request, dated April 30, 2013, CBP has reviewed NY N239002 and finds the ruling to be in error.  Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below, CBP is revoking ruling letter NY N239002.\r\rPursuant to section 625(c)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. §1625(c)(1)), as amended by section 623 of Title VI, notice of the proposed action was published in the Customs Bulletin, Vol. 50, No. 10, on March 9, 2016. No comments were received in response to the notice.\r\rFACTS:\r\r\tIn ruling letter NY N239002, CBP described the Nike Studio Wrap Pack, Model No. 324734, as a collection of articles put up for sale together to provide a consumer with <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction during exercise activities.  The Studio Wrap Pack is imported in a condition suitable for sale directly to users without repacking, and each Studio Wrap Pack consists of the following individual articles:\r\r1 Pair of <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps: Each <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap is constructed of strips of knit textile that has been laminated with polyurethane cellular rubber.  The strips are sewn together in a shape that wraps around the heel, lower ankle, and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, while leaving the toes exposed.  Synthetic traction dots are attached to the bottom of <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap, along slip soles that cover the heel and midfoot areas of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps account for 43.4% of the Studio Wrap Pack total cost.\r\r\u0001\rNike Studio Wrap Pack, the “<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap,” \r\rThe <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps are designed to provide a near-barefoot experience during exercise activities such as yoga, pilates, and barre, while also delivering <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction on studio and gym floor surfaces.  The <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap is also intended to be worn in combination with the Strap and is designed to fit inside the slip-on Flats, allowing a user to travel to and from the studio or gym while wearing the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap.  However, as the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap does not possess an outer sole or toe coverings, it would be impractical to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap outside, without the combined use of the Flats.\r\rNike states in its February 25, 2013 tariff classification ruling request that it intends to sell the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap as part of the Studio Wrap Pack, and in the future, separately with the Straps.\r\r2 Straps: Each Strap consists of a cellular rubber ribbon that is designed to be wrapped over the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap and around the ankle.  The Strap provides additional support to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and ankle and accessorizes the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap’s fashion appearance.  Use of the Straps with the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps is optional.\r\r\u0001\rNike Studio Wrap Pack, the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap with a tied “Strap” around the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and ankle\r\r1 Pair of slip-on Flats: The slip-on Flats consist of a textile-majority upper with a rubber/plastic outer sole.  The Flats have no closure devices and are designed to be worn over the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps or separately, without the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps, in combination with the removable Insoles.  Nike states that the Flats account for 32% of the Studio Wrap pack’s total cost.\r\r\u0001\rNike Studio Wrap Pack, the “Flat,” worn over a <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wrap with tied Strap\r\r2 Insoles: The removable Insoles are designed to be optionally inserted into the Flats and are constructed of textile-covered foam.  A consumer, when not wearing the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps, can insert the Insoles into the Flats for additional cushioning while walking.\r\r1 Mesh Bag: The Mesh Bag is constructed of synthetic fibers and is large enough to hold the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Straps.  It is designed to provide the consumer with a protective bag in which to launder the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Straps.  The design of the Mesh Bag allows water and detergent to rinse and clean the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Straps, while simultaneously protecting the items from damage during the washing cycle.\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhether the Nike Studio Wrap Pack is properly classified, pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 3(b), as goods put up in sets for retail sale, or whether the individual components of the Studio Wrap Pack should be separately classified, by application of GRI 1, in their respective headings.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tMerchandise imported into the United States is classified under the HTSUS.  Tariff classification is governed by the principals set forth in the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs) and, in the absence of special language or context with requires otherwise, by the Additional U.S. Rules of Interpretation.  The GRIs and the Additional U.S. Rules of Interpretation are part of the HTSUS and are to be considered statutory provisions of law for all purposes.\r\r\tGRI 1 requires that classification be determine first according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes and, unless otherwise required, according to the remaining GRIs taken in their appropriate order.\r\r\tThe HTSUS provisions under consideration in this case are as follows:\r\r6402\tOther footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics\r\r6404\tFootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While not legally binding, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HS and are thus useful in ascertaining the proper classification of merchandise.  It is CBP’s practice to follow, whenever possible, the terms of the ENs when interpreting the HTSUS.  See T.D. 89-90, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989).\r\rAs an initial matter, CBP observes that the Nike Studio Wrap Pack consists of a variety of individual articles (the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps, Flats, Straps, Insoles, and Mesh Bag), packaged together for retail sale, that are, prima facie, classifiable in two or more headings.  Specifically, there is no dispute that the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps are described by heading 6402, HTSUS; the Flats are described by heading 6404, HTSUS; the Straps are described by heading 6307, HTSUS; the Insoles are described by heading 6406, HTSUS; and that the Mesh Bag is described by heading 6307, HTSUS.  \r\rConsequently, because the Nike Studio Wrap Pack is, prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected by application of GRI 3—specifically GRI 3(b), which directs that “[g]oods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character.” \u0002  \r\rFor purposes of tariff classification under GRI 3(b), the term “sets for retail sale” carries a specific meaning that is defined in detail by EN (X) to GRI 3(b).  Specifically, EN (X) to GRI 3(b) states: \r\r(X)\tFor the purpose of this Rule, the term 'goods put up in sets for retail sale' shall be taken to mean goods which:\r\r(a)\tconsist of at least two different articles which are, prima facie, classifiable in  different headings . . . ;\r\r(b)\tconsist of products or articles put up together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity; and\r \r(c)\tare put up in a manner suitable for sale directly to users without repacking (e.g., in boxes or cases or on boards).\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\rUpon consideration of whether the component articles of the Nike Studio Wrap Pack are properly classifiable as a “set” under GRI 3, there is no dispute that the merchandise is described by criteria (a) and (c), as set forth in EN (X) to GRI 3(b).  Consistent with EN (X)(a) and (c) to GRI 3(b), the individual component articles of the Studio Wrap Pack are, prima facie, classifiable in different headings; likewise, the articles are packaged together in a retail box that is suitable for sale directly to users without repacking.  Consequently, because the Nike Studio Wrap Pack satisfies criterion (a) and (c) of the EN (X) to GRI 3(b), the determination as to whether the Studio Wrap Pack is classifiable as “goods put up in sets for retail sale” turns on whether the merchandise is also described by EN(X)(b), which states that “sets” must consist of products or articles put up “to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity.”\r\rThe courts have provided guidance on the meaning of “products or articles put up together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity” for purposes of classification pursuant to GRI 3(b). See Estee Lauder, Inc. v. United States, 815 F. Supp. 2d 1287, 1294 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2012).  In Estee Lauder, the Court of International Trade (CIT) considered the classification of several cosmetic items put up together for retail sale, and concluded that because each item was specifically related to makeup and possessed an identifiable, individual function that was intended for use together or in conjunction with one another for the single activity of putting on makeup, the cosmetic items met the particular need of makeup application and were therefore, properly classified pursuant to GRI 3(b). Id. at 1295-96.  Noting that each of the exemplars provided in the ENs consist of individual components that are used together or in conjunction with another for a single purpose or activity, the CIT agreed that “for goods put up together to meet the ‘particular need’ or ‘specific activity’ requirement and thereby be deemed a set, they must be so related as to be clearly intended for use together or in conjunction with one another for a single purpose or activity.” Id. (citing with approval CBP’s Informed Compliance Publication, “Classification of Sets”, 12 (2004)).\u0002\r\rConsistent with the courts’ interpretation of the terms “particular need” and “specific activity” in EN (X)(b) to  GRI 3(b), CBP finds that the individual component articles of the Nike Studio Wrap Pack are put up together for use in a single purpose or activity.  Specifically, they are designed for use in conjunction with one another to provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and floor traction during yoga, pilates, and barre exercise activities.  \r\rMoreover, CBP notes that the complementary design of the individual component articles makes it such that a consumer would not purchase the Studio Wrap Pack to use the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps or Flats without the other.  That the Flats may be used as conventional footwear, independent of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps, does not negate the fact that the Flats are put up with the other component articles for the particular activity of exercising.  Consequently, upon consideration of the character and use of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps, Straps, Flats, Insoles, and Mesh Bag with one another, CBP concludes that the Studio Wrap Pack is fully described by EN(X)(b) to GRI 3, because the merchandise is put up together to provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and floor traction during yoga, pilates, and barre exercise activities.\r\rWith respect to the Mesh Bag included with the Studio Wrap Pack to transport, store, and wash the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Straps, CBP notes that in Estee Lauder, the CIT repeatedly referred to cases and containers, suitable for general use and classifiable elsewhere in the Nomenclature, as non-functional set components contemplated under GRI 3(b). Estee Lauder, 815 F. Supp. 2d at 1299-1300 (citing EN (X) to GRI3(b)).  In each example, the inclusion of a case or container with a set, although suitable for general use, did not negate the set’s qualification under GRI 3(b). Id. \r\rUsed in conjunction with the Studio Wrap Pack, the Mesh Bag facilitates the transport, storage, and care of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Straps which enable the Studio Wrap Pack to fulfill the specific activity that makes it a set.  The fact that the Mesh Bag is suitable for other general uses or is designed for the ancillary care and transport of only some of the set components does not negate a finding that the Mesh Bag, when considered together with the functional articles of the Studio Wrap Pack, forms part of a set that is put up together to provide a person with <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction during exercise activities.     \r\rPursuant to the text of GRI 3(b), goods put up in sets for retail sale must be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which “gives them their essential character.”\u0002  The phrase “essential character” carries specific meaning in the context of tariff classification, and the courts have defined “essential character” as, “that which is indispensable to the structure, core or condition of the article, i.e., what it is.” Structural Industries v. United States, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1330, 1336 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2005).  \r\rEN VIII to GRI 3(b) explains that “[t]he factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods,” and may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of the constituent material in relation to the use of the goods. See EN VIII to GRI 3(b).  However, among those factors identified in EN VIII to GRI 3(b), recent court decisions concerning “essential character” analysis under GRI 3(b) have primarily focused on the role of the constituent material in relation to the use of the goods. See Estee Lauder, 815 F. Supp. 2d at 1296; see also Structural Industries, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1330; Conair Corp. v. United States, 29 C.I.T. 888 (2005); Home Depot USA, Inc. v. United States, 427 F. Supp. 2d 1278 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2006), aff’d 491 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \r\rConsistent with the guidance provided by the courts and the ENs to GRI 3, CBP evaluates the functional components of a set when determining what article or component imparts a set with its essential character.  Relevant to the classification of the instant merchandise, CBP has previously found that the essential character of sets consisting of footwear sold in combination with a bag or pouch is often imparted by the functional article of footwear. See Headquarters ruling letter (“HQ”) H008845, October 3, 2008 (finding that a pair of bowling shoes imparted the essential character of a set consisting of bowling shoes, a plastic slip-on shoe cover for one of the shoes, a fabric shoe bag, and a smaller \""sole and heel\"" bag containing four interchangeable soles and four interchangeable heels ); NY N239273, dated April 2, 2013 (finding that the articles of footwear imparted the essential character of a set consisting of a pair of slip-on dance shoes and a polyester carrying pouch).\r\rHere, the essential character of the Nike Studio Wrap Pack is imparted by the functional items used to provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction for exercise activities, namely the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats.  CBP finds that the Insoles, Straps, and Mesh Bag serve supporting roles in providing <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction for purchasers.  The role of the Insoles is to provide additional cushioning for the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> when used in the Flats and is not essential to the use of the Studio Wrap Pack.  Similarly, the relative low bulk and value of the Straps and Mesh Bag, combined with the fact that the components do not provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection or traction when used independently of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats, are evidence of the components’ supportive role in facilitating the use and care of the items that enable the Studio Wrap Pack to fulfill the specific activity that makes it a set.  Accordingly, CBP finds that the Insoles, Straps, and Mesh Bag do not impart the Studio Wrap Pack with its essential character. \r\rBy contrast, it is apparent upon first impression that the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats are functional items of the Studio Wrap Pack.  The <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction and are necessary for the particular activity of the set.  Without either component, a purchaser could not protect his or her feet or gain additional traction as compared to barefoot exercise.\r\rIn determining whether the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps or Flats impart the Studio Wrap Pack with its essential character, CBP observes that the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats are designed to be used, separately or in combination with one another, to provide <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> protection and traction for exercise activities.  Accordingly, CBP finds that the articles share equal importance in fulfilling the particular need or specific activity associated with the Studio Wrap Pack. See EN(X), GRI 3(b). Similarly, the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats share similar individual unit production costs; the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats account for 43.4% and 32%, respectively, of the total production cost of the Studio Wrap Pack.  Consequently, because the specific role, function, and unit production cost of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats do not distinguish either article as uniquely indispensable to the “structure, core, or condition” of the Studio Wrap Pack, CBP cannot determine whether the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps or Flats impart the merchandise with its essential character. See Structural Industries v. United States, 360 F. Supp. 2d at 1336.\r\rWhen goods cannot be classified by reference to GRI 3(a) or 3(b), GRI (c) instructs that they shall be classified “under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.”  Here, CBP has determined that the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps and Flats are equally important to the essential character of the Studio Wrap Pack.  The <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Wraps are classifiable in heading 6402, HTSUS; and the Flats are classifiable in heading 6404, HTSUS.  Accordingly, by application of GRI 3(c), CBP finds that the Nike Studio Wrap Pack is classifiable in heading 6404, HTSUS, which provides for, “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials.”\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tBy application of GRI 3(c), the Nike Studio Wrap Pack is classified in heading 6404, HTSUS, specifically subheading 6404.19.39, HTSUS, which provides for “Footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: Footwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: Other: Footwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except footwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper: Other: Other.”  The column one, general rate of duty under this provision is 37.5%, ad valorem.\r\rDuty rates are provided for convenience only and are subject to change.

The upper is fabric and covers the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> from just forward of the instep to the back of the heel, but not any of the toes.  The two sides of the upper open wide to allow the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> to be set down on the insole without bending.  The sides of the upper are secured by two fabric straps.  The straps have hook and loop closures.  The sample is symmetrical down its long axis, i.e., it is neither a “left” nor a “right”, and its insole is unusually wide, about 4 inches across the base of the wearer’s toes, compared to its length, 10 inches.  It is not labeled with a shoe size, but “S”, which we take to be Small.  These facts support your claim that they will be worn only following <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> surgery (or perhaps fracture), routinely via a physician’s prescription.   \r\r\tFrom the above we assume the merchandise normally will be imported and sold in single units, not pairs.\r \r\tThe applicable subheading for this footwear will be 9021.19.8500, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for “other” orthopedic or fracture appliances.

The item is intended for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, as you state, by children aged 5 to 12 years old, for beach/sand <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> as a strap-on sandal for bare feet, or even possibly for fun as a snow <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> strap-on bottom over boots (although the textile straps of the upper do not appear to be adjustable for fit over a boot).  This novelty sandal has an upper comprised of several 1-inch wide adjustable textile material straps at the heel that encircle the wearer’s ankle and a single 2-inch wide adjustable textile vamp strap at the front over the toes.  Both the front and the back set of upper straps have hook-and-loop closures and are secured into and under a flat rubber/plastic midsole that is shaped to resemble a 6-inch wide and 11-inch long webbed reptile <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  This stylized “lizard” <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> shaped sandal bottom also has a ¾-inch thick rubber/plastic outer sole which will contact the ground, that has been molded to the contours of a three toed animal/dinosaur, complete with scales and claws.  We agree with you that children will <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> this sandal for the novelty and the fun of leaving strange footprints behind in the sand and so it is not intended for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> on a continuous basis.  Nevertheless, this unusually shaped sandal is not merely an item of flimsy or toy-like construction intended only for amusement or play, but was designed to be comfortably worn as an item of footwear classifiable in Chapter 64, HTS.  \r\r\tThe applicable subheading for this sandal, identified as “Wacky Trax” will be 6402.19.35, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for footwear, in which the upper’s external surface is predominately textile materials (excluding accessories or reinforcements); in which the outer sole’s external surface is predominately rubber and/or plastics; which is not “athletic footwear”; which has open toes or open heels; and which is over 10% by weight of rubber and/or plastics.  The rate of duty will be 37.5% ad valorem.   \r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

All entries were\rliquidated on April 7, 1995.  A sample was provided to this\roffice for examination.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The merchandise at issue is a women's espadrille shoe,\rreferenced style name \""Mogul\"", which consists of a textile upper\rwhich features a closed toe and heel, a wedge shaped jute\rplatform midsole and a rubber outer sole.  The shoe has ten metal\reyelet holes situated near the top edges of the upper, which are\rspaced in a symmetrical pattern around the circumference of the\rtopline opening.  A 5/8 inch wide flat textile lace is laced into\rthe eyelets; after exiting the last pair of eyelets the ends are\rstill sufficiently long so that they can be wrapped and securely\rtied around the wearer's ankle.\r\r     The Protestant claims that the shoe was improperly\rclassified by Customs in subheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: other:\rvalued over $6.50 but not over $12/pair.  The Protestant argues\rthat the rubber on the outer sole merely serves as reinforcement\rand that accordingly, style Mogul should be classified in\rsubheading 6405.20.30, HTSUSA, which provides for other footwear;\rwith uppers of textile materials: with uppers of vegetable\rfibers.  In the alternative, the Protestant argues that the lace\rstrap is an ornamental feature which does not significantly hold\rthe shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer and that the shoe is held to\rthe <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by the close fitting design of the upper.  Accordingly,\rclassification is proposed in subheading 6404.19.25, HTSUSA,\rwhich provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: footwear\rwith open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that\ris held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other\rfasteners, the foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20\rand except footwear having a foxing or foxing-like band wholly or\ralmost wholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole\rand overlapping the upper: less than 10 percent by weight of\rrubber or plastics: with uppers of vegetable fibers.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     What is the proper classification of the merchandise at\rissue?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff\rSchedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is in accordance\rwith the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 requires\rthat classification be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes.  Where goods\rcannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, the remaining\rGRI will be applied, in the order of their appearance.\r\r     Classification of goods under chapter 64, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for footwear, is determined by the materials that\rcomprise the outer soles and uppers.  Note 4(b) to that chapter\rprovides that:\r\r     The constituent material of the outer sole shall be taken to\r     be the material having the greatest surface area in contact\r     with the ground, no account being taken of accessories or\r     reinforcements such as spikes, bars, nails, protectors or\r     similar attachments.\r\r     The Protestant's first claim states that the subject shoe\rhas a jute outer sole merely reinforced with a layer of rubber;\rthe rubber serves to \""reinforce the jute outer sole primarily at\rthe toe, heel, and along its perimeter\"".  As further evidence\rthat the rubber serves merely as reinforcement, he adds that when\rthe identical merchandise is sold without the rubber\rreinforcement, exposing the jute outer sole, the subject footwear\ris considered to have outer soles of textile in accordance with\rNote 4(b).\r\r\r\r\r\r     Although Note 4(b) does provide as an exception to the outer\rsole having the greatest contact with the ground, any\r\""accessories or attachments\"", it similarly defines those terms. \rThe words \""accessories\"" and \""reinforcements\"" are followed by a\rlimited number of defining exemplars such as spikes, bars, nails,\rprotectors or similar attachments.  To conclude that by\rsimilitude an entire external surface layer of rubber soling is\rincluded within the meaning of \""similar attachments\"" is not only\runfounded but clearly contradicts the intended meaning of Note\r4(b).  The rubber soling on the subject merchandise does not\rmerely \""reinforce\"" the toe, heel and the perimeter of the shoe. \rTo the contrary, the rubber completely covers the jute bottom of\rthe shoe and acts as a rubber outer sole.  Furthermore, to add\rthat identical merchandise sold without the rubber reinforcement\ris considered to have outer soles of textile gives further\rsupport to our position that the subject merchandise has rubber\routersoles.  Merchandise is classified by Customs on a case by\rcase basis.  Shoes such as these, without rubber outer soles and\rwhich expose the existing jute midsoles would naturally be\rclassified based on the textile midsoles, which in this case\rwould serve as outer soles.  Customs has consistently classified\rthis type of espadrille shoe with a jute platform midsole and a\rheat molded-on rubber <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> surface bottom as footwear with outer\rsoles of rubber or plastics.  See e.g., HQ 953483, dated July 29,\r1993.  As such, it is our opinion that the subject merchandise\rhas an outer sole of rubber, and cannot be classified in heading\r6405, HTSUSA.\r\r     Protestant's second claim states that the textile fashion\rlace or strap merely serves as an ornamental fashion feature\rwhich does not hold the shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer.  In\rsupport of this claim reference is made to HQ 073384, dated\rDecember 22, 1983 and HQ 801649, dated November 24, 1981.  In HQ\r073384, discussing a women's imitation moccasin style casual\rshoe, Customs determined that the sample shoe was of the slip-on\rtype because:\r\r     the lace is not a functional fastener noting that it is sewn\rdown where it passes through  both the plug and the collar. \r                              Moreover, we would call this a\r                              slip-on even if the lace were not\r                              sewn down because wearers of this\r                              type of footwear normally tie the\r                              lace once to fit the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, and then\r                              slip the shoe on and off without\r                              retying the lace.\r\r     Unlike the submitted shoe, the shoe of HQ 073384 featured a\rnon-functioning lace which had been sewn down where it passes\rthrough the collar and the eyelets in the plug.  Notwithstanding,\rthe shoe in question in HQ 073384 was not like the subject\respadrille shoe which encases the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> with a soft textile upper\rbut a more rigid moccasin style shoe.  Thus, the lace strap on\rthe moccasin could easily be tied once to fit the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> allowing\rthe moccasin to be slipped on and off without further use of the\rlace strap. The same could not be said for the subject\respadrille.  The lace strap functions to conform the shoe snugly\rto the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer.  Once this is done, although it might\rbe possible to slip the shoe off, it would be more difficult to\rslip it back on without the textile upper folding into itself\rwhen the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> enters the shoe.\r\r     In HQ 801649, discussing a canvas, mock toe, rolled sole\rwoman's casual shoe, Customs determined that the sample shoe was\rof the slip-on type because:\r\r\r     The lace can be tied and untied and by pulling on the lace\r     ends through the kiltie and by tightly tying them together\r     (to keep the kiltie from returning to its usual position)\r     the shoe can be made somewhat tighter around the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>. \r     However, the effect is limited and rather awkward so we\r     believe this will rarely be done, almost certainly not each\r     time the shoe is worn.  Therefore, despite the lace, we\r     consider this a slip-on shoe.\r     \r     Although the shoe of HQ 801649 has a lace strap which allows\rthe ends to be tied together to make the shoe tighter around the\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, the ruling states that its effects are limited and awkward. \rTherefore, the presumption is that this unnecessary task will be\roften, if not always, skipped when putting on the shoe. As was\rdiscussed above, the design of the subject shoe does not\rfacilitate this option.  The subject espadrille features a lace\rstrap which is not only functional, but would render the ability\rto put on the shoe difficult without the use of the lace strap. \rThe shoe would easily collapse under the weight of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of\rthe wearer if the lace ends were not consistently readjusted\revery time the shoe was worn, regardless of their length.  Thus,\ralthough the long lace may have been designed to be wrapped\raround the ankle merely for its ornamental appeal, the design of\rthe shoe requires that the lace be passed around the wearer's\rankle and tied to hold the shoe to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Additionally, it\rshould be noted that contrary to the Protestant's assertion that\rthe shoe stays securely on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> even without the use of the\rlace strap, when the submitted shoe was worn without the use of\rthe lace strap, the shoe slipped off the wearer's <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>. \rAccordingly, it is our position that the submitted sample is not\rof the slip-on type and that it has a rubber/plastic outer sole.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     The subject espadrille shoe, referenced style name \""Mogul\"",\rwas correctly classified in subheading 6404.19.80, HTSUSA, which\rprovides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics: other: other:\rvalued over $6.50 but not over $12/pair.  The applicable rate of\rduty is 90 cents/pr plus 20 perecent ad valorem.\r\r     The protest should be denied in full and a copy of this\rruling should be appended to the CF 19 Notice of Action to\rsatisfy the notice requirement of section 174.30(a) Customs\rRegulations.\r\r     In accordance with Section 3(A)(11)(b) of Customs Directive\r099 3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject: Revised Protest\rDirective, this decision should be mailed by your office to the\rProtestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter. \rAny reliquidation of the entry in accordance with the decision\rmust be accomplished prior to mailing of the decision.

P.C.  \rSixty-seven Broad Street\rNew York, N.Y.  10004 \r\rRE:  Boots, hiking;  Athletic footwear; T.D. 92-32; Additional\r     U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64 \r\rDear Mr Baskin:\r\r     In a letter dated March 11, 1993, to the Regional\rCommissioner of Customs in New York, on behalf of Hi-Tec Sports\rUSA, Inc., you inquired as to the tariff classification under the\rHarmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), of three\rhiking boots produced in Korea.  Your letter, together with the\rsamples and descriptive literature which were submitted for\rexamination, were forwarded to this office for a response.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The samples are designated as styles GT Max, GT Rugged and\rthe Yazoo.  The GT Max consists of a nylon mesh upper covered\rextensively with full grain nubuk overlays, a phylon midsole, and\ran all-terrain carbon rubber outer sole.  The footwear is an\rover-the-ankle style, features stitched toe bumpers, and weighs\r14.5 ounces in a men's size 8.\r\r     THe GT Rugged is comprised of a nylon upper that is covered\rextensively with nubuk overlays, an EVA midsole, and a carbon\rrubber, wrap-around outsole.  The footwear is an over-the-ankle\rstyle, features stitched toe bumpers, and weighs 13.5 ounces in a\rmen's size 8.\r\r     The Yazoo consists of a nylon mesh upper, which is more than\r50 percent covered with suede overlays, an EVA midsole, and a\rhigh traction carbon rubber outer sole,  It is a \""high-top\"" style\rof footwear featuring thickly padded ankles, moisture wicking\rlining, stitched toe bumpers, and trail stabilizers.  It weighs\r16 ounces in a men's size 8. \r\r\r                               -2-\r\r     You claim that these hiking shoes are classifiable under\rsubheading 6404.11.20, HTSUS, as footwear with outer soles or\rrubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of\rtextile materials, footwear with outer soles of rubber or\rplastics, sports footwear, tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym\rshoes, training shoes and the like, having uppers of which over\r50 percent of the external surface area (including any leather\raccessories or reinforcements such as those mentioned in note\r4(a) to this chapter) is leather.  The applicable rate of duty\rfor this provision is 10.5% ad valorem.      \r\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Does the language of Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64,\rHTSUS, expand the coverage of subheading 6404.11, HTSUS\r\r     Are the hiking boots considered \""athletic footwear\"" for\rpurposes of classification under subheading 6404.11.20, HTUS?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     The term \""tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes,\rtraining shoes and the like\"" appearing in subheading 6404.11,\rHTSUS, is defined by Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64, HTSUS,\rwhich reads as follows:\r\r     2.   For the purposes of this chapter, the term \""tennis\r          shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and\r          the like\"" covers athletic footwear other than sports\r          footwear (as defined in subheading note 1 above)\r          whether or not principally used for such athletic games\r          or purposes.\r\r     It is claimed that Customs erred in T.D. 92-32 by requiring\rthat the hiking/backpacking boots at issue therein be \""like\""\rtennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, and training shoes.\rThe reason assigned for this error is that by inserting\rAdditional U.S. Note 2 into Chapter 64, HTSUS, Congress expressly\rdescribed what the phrase \""tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym\rshoes, training shoes and the like should cover.  Consequently,\ran analysis of whether the hiking/backpacking boots were \""like\""\rtennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes and training shoes     \rshould have been an irrelevant consideration.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              -3- \r\r     You assert that \""[i]t is a 'well-settled rule of statutory\rconstruction that for the purpose of ascertaining the intention\rof Congress, the entire context of the statute must be considered\rand every effort made to give full force and effect to all\rlanguage contained therein.' . . . To say that a definition is\rrestricted by the terminology of the phrase it is defining is to\rrender the definition void, meaningless, and of no effect, for\rthe very purpose of inserting a definition into a statute is to\rensure that the defined phrase is interpreted in accordance with\rthe definition, regardless of what the terms in the phrase might\rotherwise imply. . . .\""\r\r     Additional Note 2 to Chapter 64, HTSUS, neither restricts\rnor expands upon the terminology of subheading 6404.11, HTSUS. \rThe U.S. Note  merely clarifies the distinction between sports\rfootwear and other athletic footwear.  Further, a fair reading of\rthe note reveals that its purpose was to clarify that it was not\rnecessary for Customs to determine the \""principal use\"" of each\rstyle imported as \""like\"" due presumably to the blurring of the\rlines between \""athletic\"" and casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> in athletic shoes,\r(e.g., \""athleisure\"" shoes).  \r\r     In T.D. 92-32 (16 Cust. Bull. 4), responding to the claim of\rimporters that the hiking/backing boot is classifiable as\rathletic footwear, Customs stated at page 18 the following:\r\r          In this instance the hiking/backpacking boot, although\r          used in the sport of backpacking, fails to qualify as\r          athletic footwear within subheading 6404.11 because it\r          is not \""like\"" tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym\r          shoes, and training shoes.  Specifically, hiking boots\r          are heavier than the listed exemplars of athletic\r          footwear.  This slows the wearer's running speed\r          substantially.  All the exemplars are used in sports\r          which require fast footwork or extensive running. \r          Additionally, the exemplars are not constructed so as\r          to protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against rough and rocky terrain as\r          are hiking boots.  For these reasons we conclude that\r          the hiking/backpacking boot is not classifiable under\r          subheading 6404.11, as claimed. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                               -4-\r\r     You also assert that the reasons stated above for not\rconsidering hiking boots as athletic footwear are incorrect for\rthe following reasons:  \r\r     1.   The hiking shoes in issue are no heavier than for\r          example, the average pair of a corresponding size of\r          basketball shoes.  In fact, the literature of the GT\r          Max and the GT Rugged specifically state that those\r          styles are \""[l]ightweight shoe[s] designed  with an\r          outsole ideal for mountain biking, short distance trail\r          running, or day hiking with lightweight pack.\""\r          (Emphasis added.)        \r\r     2.   Customs contended that all the exemplars were used in\r          sports requiring fast footwork or extensive running. \r          The sport of hiking requires fast footwork and/ or\r          running -- for example, to cross a hazardous path, to\r          leap across a gap or over a barrier, or to escape the\r          elements or potential danger.  Further, the active\r          hiker/backpacker will incorporate sporadic jogging-\r          like running (frequently between one-quarter to one-\r          half mile intervals) into their day-long hikes. \r\r     3.   If footwear had to be used in a sport requiring\r          extensive running or fast footwear, in order to fall\r          within the purview of \""like\"" footwear under subheading\r          6404.11, HTSUS, then footwear such as aerobic shoes\r          would be excluded from that provision.  However, the\r          sporting goods industry in the United States clearly\r          considered aerobic footwear and other footwear not\r          requiring extensive running (e.g., walking shoes) to\r          come within the footwear category known as athletic\r          footwear\r\r     4.   The claim by Customs that the exemplars are not\r          constructed so as to protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> against rough and\r          rocky terrain is not correct.  These shoes have\r          characteristics such as carbon rubber outsoles, lugs on\r          outer soles, EVA midsoles, heel counters, heel\r          stabilizers, nylon mesh/leather uppers, removable sock\r          liners, padded heel tabs, padded collars, padded\r          tongues, lateral stabilizer straps, double toe foxings\r          and adjustable width lacings which protect the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>\r          against rough and rocky terrain. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              -5- \r\r     With respect to aerobic shoes, it should be noted those with\rtextile uppers and soles of rubber or plastics are classifiable\runder 6404.11, HTSUS, as \""athletic footwear.\""  However, 99\rpercent of imported aerobic shoes have leather or plastic uppers\rwhich require classification in heading 6402 or 6403, HTSUS,\rwhere the \""athletic \"" distinction does not appear.  Contrary to\ryour assertion, aerobics, particularly \""high-impact\"" aerobics\rrequire \""fast footwork\"" and \""extensive running\"" action, albeit   \rnormally in place.  Due to the need for high skid resistance, for\rprotection of the sides of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> during <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> sliding on a hard\rsurface, and for protection from the jarring heel impact when\rrunning in place or jumping, aerobic shoes are made like and look\rlike a hybrid of tennis shoes, basketball shoes and training\r(jogging) shoes.  We note that no \""low impact\"" aerobic shoes are\rsold.  \""Low-impactors\"" normally <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> regular aerobic shoes\rcapable of \""higher-impact\"" use or tennis or gym shoes.  They\rnever <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> any kind of hiking boot. \r\r     Taking the exemplars in subheading 6404.11, HTSUS, into\raccount and disregarding the treatment of aerobics, it is quite\robvious that the Hi-Tec Backpacking Series such as the \""Yazoo,\""\rwith, among other things, its distinct heel, its  upper extending \rway over the ankle, its very thick sole to protect against sharp\rrocks, and its steel shank, obviously does not belong in\rsubheading 6404.11, HTSUS.  \r\r      The General Terrain Series such as the GT Rugged and the GT\rMax are more problematic.  They are quite similar; the GT Max is\ra little heavier and more \""hikeish\"" than the GT Rugged.  Due to\rthe studs, they are clearly different from the \""hard surface\""\rathletics, i.e., tennis, basketball and gym shoes.  However, they\rare suitable for \""short distance trail running.\""  Therefore,\rthere are several similarities between these two and the subset\rof jogging shoes which are appropriate for use on unpaved\rsurfaces.   \r\r     Unlike the training shoes, these shoes have the following\rconspicuous differences:\r\r     1.   a \""heel\"" stabilizer which on the \""in\"" side of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>\r          extends past the mid point of the shoe; \r\r     2.   stitched and cemented on, molded rubber heel and toe\r          bumpers; \r      \r     3.   outersoles which are considerably heavier and stiffer\r          (although substantially less so than the usual hiker)\r          and which have a quite different design and spacing for\r          the \""studs;\"" and\r\r     4.   Uppers which cover the ankle. \r\r                              -6- \r\r     Based on the foregoing, it is our opinion that the above-\rlisted differences between the shoes in issue and the exemplars\rlisted in subheading 6404.11, HTSUS, prevents them from being\rconsidered \""like\"" those exemplars.  Consequently, styles GT Max,\rGT Rugged and Yazoo are classifiable under 6404.19, TSUS, which\rprovides for footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics,\rleather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials,\rfootwear with outer soles of rubber or plastics, other.  \r\r     \r     Inasmuch as you have stated that you are interested only in\rthe \""athletic\"" issue, we have not gone beyond the six digit\rclassification.  To provide an eight digit classification, we\rwould need additional information (e.g., whether the shoes have\rprotective features).   \r      \rHOLDING: \r\r     The language of Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chaspter 64,\rHTSUS, does not expand the coverage of subheading 6404.11, HTSUS. \r\r     The GT Max, GTR Rugged and the Yazoo are not considered\r\""athletic footwear\"" for purposes of classification under\rsubheading 6404.11.20, HTSUS.  \r\r     The GT Max, GT Rugged and the Yazoo are classifiable udner\rsubheading 6404.19, HTSUS.\r\r \r                                   Sincerely, \r\r\r\r                                   John Durant, Director \r                                   Commercial Rulings Division \r\r\r \r\r\u001A\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/1993/953882.doc"",""id"":9520,""rulingNumber"":""953882"",""subject"":""Boots, hiking;  Athletic footwear; T.D. 92-32; Additional     U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 64"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""1993-09-24T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6404.11.20""]}"

The unique feature of these safety boots is that the outsoles are removable and interchangeable.  Thus different soles may easily be employed to provide the characteristics needed in different conditions.”\r\r\tThe sample is a hiking shoe with an indented rubber/plastics bottom specially designed to accommodate different outer soles.  The shoe, no style number indicated, covers the ankle and has an upper of leather and textile material.  It is secured to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by a lace closure system.  You state that the upper is calculated to be 52.46% leather.  You have also submitted two outer soles designed for the shoe.  One outer sole is composed of rubber/plastics material and the other is composed of textile material with metal studs or lugs.  It is our understanding that the item will be imported with both outer soles packaged with the shoes.\r\r\tClassification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) is in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI’s) taken in order. General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 3, HTS, deals with goods which are, prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings.  The shoe in this case is classified under heading 6403 if imported with the rubber/plastic sole and under heading 6405 if imported with the textile sole.  GRI 3(c), HTS, states that the goods must be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those equally meriting consideration.  \u000B\u000B \tThe applicable subheading for the shoe will be 6405.10.00, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, (HTS), which provides for other footwear with uppers of leather.  The general rate of duty will be 10 percent ad valorem.  \r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

The boots have identically constructed uppers of predominately rubber/plastics materials; the men’s boot is mostly black in color, accented with bright red plastic impact shielding, while the women’s boot is grey and black in color and has black plastic impact shielding.  Both boots have slide fastener closures and suede leather material inside quarters that extend up the side of the boot shaft and are secured with hook-and-loop fastenings.

You state that the boots are not waterproof and are constructed to help protect the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> from bruises and abrasions.  They do not have any added padding or insulation intended as a protection against cold or inclement weather.

The items in Style XT250 are constructed from 64% polyester, 24% nylon, 12% elastane, finely knit fabric that is napped on the inside surface. The flat outer surface provides resistance to abrasion caused by contact with the inside of a drysuit and the inner surface wicks moisture off the skin, both from perspiration and from drysuit leaks. \r\rThe pullover top, XT250 T, has a reverse fabric mock turtleneck; long, hemmed, raglan sleeves; elastic thumb loops at the sleeve ends; flat lock seams; and a hemmed bottom with a curved tail.  The pants, XT250 L, have a tunnel elastic waistband with an outside drawstring; flat lock seams; and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> stirrups at the ankles.  The vest, Style XT250 V, has oversized armholes; a low, round neckline in the front and in the back; and a straight, hemmed bottom.  The socks, XT250 S, are drysuit socks.  They extend above the ankles and have flat lock seams and a hemmed top.  The beanie hat, Style XT250 H, is a four-panel beanie hat with a cuff.  The items are imported in a rectangular nylon woven bag, XT250 B, that measures 13 inches by 17 inches and has a drawstring closure, reinforced corners and braided shoulder straps.

Pellegrini\rRoss & Hardies\r65 East 55th Street\rNew York, NY 10022-3219\r\rRE:  The tariff classification of footwear.\r\rDear Mr. Pellegrini:\r\r     In your letter dated July 23, 1998 you requested a\rclassification ruling on behalf of your client, Timberland\rCompany for their  \""Dunewalkers\"" series,  styles 87043, 87047,\r87048 and 87049.  You have provided a sample of a shoe which you\ridentify as style 87047. You state that the styles are identical\rbut for color.\r\r     You describe the footwear as a man's six-eyelet oxford with\ra textile upper and a rubber/plastic cup outsole.  The outsole\roverlaps the upper around the entire circumference of the shoe. \rThe outsole is attached to the upper by cementing and by\rstitching the toe and heel areas.  Your inquiry concerns whether\ror not this type of shoe is considered \""tennis shoes, basketball\rshoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like\"" as defined in\rAdditional U.S. Note 2, Chapter 64, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of\rthe United States, (HTS).\r\r     As you state, Additional U.S. Note 2, Chapter 64  (HTS),\rdefines the term \""tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes,\rtraining shoes and the like\"" as athletic footwear other than\rsports footwear (as defined in subheading note 1 to Chapter 64\r(HTS)), whether or not principally used for such athletic games\ror purposes. \r\r     As you further state, previous Customs rulings have\rattempted to distinguish athletic footwear by the presence of\rphysical characteristics typical of tennis shoes, basketball\rshoes, gym shoes and training shoes.  In HQ 953882 dated\rSeptember 24, 1993, Customs rejected the contention that certain\rhiking boots are classifiable as athletic footwear, citing\rcertain conspicuous differences between hiking boots and athletic\rfootwear and the like.  Specifically, the hikers featured:\r\r     1.  A \""heel\"" stabilizer on the \""in\"" side of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> which\rextends past the mid point of the       shoe;\r\r     2.  Stitched and cemented on, molded rubber heel and toe\rbumpers;\r\r     3.  Outersoles which are considerably heavier and stiffer\r(although substantially less so         than the usual hiker) and\rwhich have a quite different design and spacing for the        \r\""studs;\"" and\r\r     4. Uppers which cover the ankle.      \r\r     In T.D. 92-32 (16 Cust. Bull. & Dec. 4), Customs ruled that\ra hiking/backpacking boot failed to qualify as \""athletic\rfootwear.\""  Specifically, the hiking/backpacking boot is not\r\""like\"" tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes and training\rshoes as they are heavier than the listed exemplars of athletic\rfootwear.  This slows the wearer's running speed substantially. \rAll the exemplars are used in sports which require fast footwork\ror extensive running.  In HQ 955224 dated March 25, 1994, Customs\ragreed that certain off-road protective footwear qualified as\r\""athletic footwear.\""  Among the reasons presented supporting\rclassification as \""athletic footwear\"" was:\r\r     1.  The footwear is constructed along the same general lines\ras athletic footwear.  The         only real difference is the\routersole which is somewhat heavier than some, but not all,           jogging shoes.  It is no less flexible.\r\r     2.  The footwear is light; it is not heavier than athletic\rfootwear.  It is consistent with the         weight of athletic\rfootwear.\r\r     3.  The footwear is designed for use in activities which\rrequire fast footwork and          extensive running.     \r\r     Aside from the physical appearance, the identification of\rbasketball shoes, tennis shoes, (i.e. court shoes) gym shoes and\rtraining shoes is generally dependent upon (but not limited to),\rthe presence of certain construction features incorporated into\rthe shoes.  These features include special arch supports, shock\rabsorbers, lateral stabilizers and special traction soles.  No\rsuch readily discernable features are evident in the type of \rhybrid casual/athletic \""athleisure\"" shoes which are the subject\rof this ruling request.  The only characteristics consistently\revident in the cited rulings which differentiate \""athletic\"" from\rother types of footwear in addition to materials and appearance,\ris the weight of the shoe and the relative flexibility of the\router sole enabling the wearer to participate in activities\rrequiring fast footwork and running.   These factors must be\rexamined and applied to this type of athletic/casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>\rfootwear.   These shoes are certainly lightweight and flexible\renough to be used in athletic activities, whether or not they are\rprincipally used for such athletic games or purposes.  They are\rconstructed along the same general lines as athletic shoes,\rpossessing a light weight canvas upper secured by a lace tie\rclosure.  They have a light weight, flexible athletic like rubber\ror plastic outer sole which overlaps the upper and is a foxing or\rfoxing-like band similar to those found on many athletic court\rand training shoes.  This type of sole provides the necessary\rtraction and stability to participate competitively in athletic\rendeavors.  These shoes are not unusual for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> while\rparticipating in athletic activities.  The literature provided\remphasizes the shoe's dependable long <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, describing them as\rlightweight and flexible.\r     \r     The applicable subheading for \""Dunewalkers\"" styles 87043,\r87047, 87048 and 87049 will be 6404.11.90, Harmonized Tariff\rSchedule of the United States, (HTS) which provides for footwear\rwith outer soles of rubber or plastics and uppers of textile\rmaterials, which are athletic,  valued over $12/pair.  The rate\rof duty will be 20 percent ad valorem.\r\r     The submitted sample is not marked with the country of\rorigin.  Therefore, if imported as is, will not meet the country\rof origin marking requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1304.  Accordingly,\rthe footwear would be considered not legally marked under the\rprovisions of 19 C.F.R. 134.11 which states, \""every article of\rforeign origin (or its container) imported into the U.S. shall be\rmarked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and\rpermanently as the nature of the article (or container) will\rpermit, in such manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser\rin the U.S. the English name of the country of origin of the\rarticle.\""\r\r     This ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177\rof the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r     A copy of this ruling letter or the control number indicated\rabove should be provided with the entry documents filed at the\rtime this merchandise is imported.

O'Hara, Esq. \rStein, Shostak, Shostak & O'Hara \r3580 Wilshire Boulevard \rLos Angeles, California 90010-2597 \r\rRE:  Footwear, athletic, w/removable liners;  Liners removable;  \r     Sets;  Composite goods;  Essential character;  External\r     surface area;  T.D. 84-59;  HRL's 955705, 952170, 086055,\r     953219, 953452\r\rDear Mr. O'Hara: \r\r     This is in reference to an inquiry dated December 14, 1993,\ron behalf of addidas U.S.A., Inc., concerning the tariff\rclassification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United\rStates Annotated (HTSUSA), of an athletic shoe with a removable\rliner.  Samples were submitted for examination.  \r\rFACTS: \r\r     The sample submitted, article 074192, is a man's basketball\r[athletic] shoe consisting of a lace-up \""frame\"" and a removable\rliner. This shoe \""frame\"" has a unit-molded plastic sole and a\rplastic upper.  The sole overlaps all of the perimeter of the\rupper by 1/4 inch or more and therefore, the shoe has a foxing-\rlike band.  The \""frame\"" upper has six cutouts through which the\rliner is visible.  The two cutouts at the instep and its lateral\requivalent each have their top and bottom edges joined by three\r7/16 inch wide textile strips.  There is a plastic pull loop that\rrises above the back of the \""frame.\""  In place of eyelet stays\rand eyelets, there are narrow metal rods which pass through the\rupper and create  eyelets through which the shoe will be laced. \rAttached at the front of the upper by two elastic textile strips\ron each side in part of the space that would normally contain the\rtongue is a plastic oval made from the same material as the rest\rof the upper.  Below this oval is another open area through which\rthe liner is visible. \r\r\r\r     The liner is a slip-on, over-the-ankle bootie with an upper\rmade of a textile-plastic foam-textile sandwich.  It has an\rapplied plastic sole which is molded with a tread which makes the\rbootie suitable for (limited) <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> as footwear without the frame. \rInasmuch as the \""frame\"" does not have a lining, it cannot be worn\rwithout the removable liner.  We have been informed that in\rnormal use, the liner will remain in the frame when the wearer\rremoves his <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> from the shoe.  When the liner is removed from\rthe shoe for washing or any other reason, it will most likely be\rreinserted into the frame before the wearer places his <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> in\rthe liner because of the great difficulty in inserting the liner\rinto the frame while on the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> of the wearer.  \r\rISSUES:  \r\r     1.   What constitutes the external surface area of the upper\r          (ESAU) of each shoe \""frame\"" and each complete shoe?  \r\r     2.   What is the classification of the shoe \""frames\""\r          imported without liners? \r\r     3.   What is the classification of the liners imported\r          without \""frames\""? \r\r     4.   What is the classification of one complete pair of\r          shoes, (i.e., one pair of shoe \""frames\"" imported with\r          one corresponding pair of liners)? \r\r     5.   What is the classification of one pair of shoe \""frames\""\r          imported with two or more pairs of liners?  \r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS: \r\r     Classification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the\rGeneral Rules of Interpretation (GRI's).  GRI 1 provides that\r\""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the\rheadings and any relative section or chapter notes, and, provided\rsuch headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to\r[the remaining GRI's taken in order].\""  In other words,\rclassification is governed first by the terms of the headings of\rthe tariff and any relative section or chapter notes.  GRI 6,\rHTSUSA, requires that the GRI's be applied at the subheading\rlevel on the understanding that only subheadings at the same\rlevel are comparable.  The GRI's apply in the same manner when\rcomparing subheadings within a heading.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                            Issue 1 \r\r     The \""frame,\"" when imported separately, has an ESAU which\rconsists of all of the visible plastic surface including the\rplastic pull loop [tab] and the plastic oval, which we consider\rto be the partial equivalent of a tongue, which is not normally\rcounted as ESAU or as accessories or reinforcements (A/R).  See\rT.D. 84-59, 18 Cust. Bull. 166 (1984). The ESAU also includes the\rsix textile strips in the instep and lateral cutouts, and the\rvisible portions of the metal rods which create the eyelets.  It\rappears likely, but would require a measurement to be certain\rthat the ESAU of the \""frame\"" without the liner will be over 90%\rplastic.  However, whether or not it is over 90% plastics does\rnot matter because the \""frame\"" has a foxing-like band which would\rpreclude its classification under subheading 6402.91.40, HTSUSA,\rwhich provides for other footwear with outer soles and uppers of\rrubber or plastics, other footwear, covering the ankle, having\ruppers of which over 90 percent of the external surface area\r(including any accessories or reinforcements such as those\rmentioned in note 4(a) to this chapter) is rubber or plastics\rexcept (1) footwear having a foxing or a foxing-like band applied\ror molded at the sole and overlapping the upper. \r\r     When the \""frame\"" and liner are imported together, the\rexternal surface area of the upper of the complete shoe includes\rall of the textile areas where the textile liner is the only\rmaterial covering the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Again, the plastic oval, which we\rconsider to be the partial equivalent of a tongue is not counted\ras ESAU or as accessories or reinforcements.  Further, textile\rwill be considered the external surface area of the upper in\rthose areas where it is visible and tactile when the tongue is\rremoved, the areas where it comes up higher than the leather, and\rall the places where it is visible and tactile through cutouts in\rthe leather.  It is clear that the \""frame\"" and liner together\rwill still have an ESAU of plastic.  However, it is equally clear\rthat the ESAU including A/R will not be over 90% plastic.  Again,\rwhether or not it is over 90% plastics does not matter because\rthe \""frame has a foxing-like band which would preclude its\rclassification under subheading 6402.91.40, HTSUSA. \r\r                          Issues 2 & 4 \r\r     Pairs of shoe \""frames\"" imported separately and valued over\r$12 per pair are classifiable under subheading 6402.91.90,\rHTSUSA, which provides for other footwear with outer soles and\ruppers of rubber or plastics, other footwear, covering the ankle,\rother, valued over $12/pair. \r\r     A pair of shoe \""frames\"" imported with a pair of liners and \rhaving a combined entered value of over $12 per pair is also\rclassifiable under subheading 6402.91.90, HTSUSA.  \r\r                            Issue 3 \r\r     In Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL) 955705 dated March 1,\r1994, Customs ruled that certain removable textile liners,\rsimilar to those in issue, are classifiable under subheading\r6406.10.9040, HTSUSA, which provides for parts of footwear,\ruppers and parts thereof, other than stiffeners, other, other, of\rtextile materials other than cotton, of man-made fibers.  The\rrationale for our position with respect to the classification of\rthis type of liner was stated as follows: \r\r          For tariff purposes a provision for parts of an article\r          covers products solely or principally used as a part of\r          such articles.  The shoe \""frames\"" involved are\r          unfinished or incomplete footwear without the liners. \r          These liners are designed for use with these shoe\r          \""frames\"" and are necessary for their completion. \r          Further, even though the liners are capable of being\r          worn outside of the shoe, they are designed for and\r          will be principally used with these shoe \""frames. \r          Consequently, the liner imported separately qualifies\r          for classification as parts of footwear for tariff\r          purposes. \r \r          The liners or booties which were the subject of HRL's\r          952170 and 086055 can be distinguished from the instant\r          liners in that they are used with finished or completed\r          footwear.  Unlike the liners in issue, they are not\r          necessary to complete the footwear.  They are\r          accessories.    \r\r     Following the reasoning set forth in HRL 955705, it is our\ropinion that the instant liners qualify for classification under\rheading 6406, HTSUSA.  \r\r     It has been suggested that the product is more than \""part of\ran upper\"" noting that the liner constitutes not only part of the\rshoe's upper but also is a removable sock lining or inner sole. \rFurther, since the liner functions at all times as a sock lining\r(inner sole), its concurrent use as part of the upper cannot be \rsaid to be the sole or principal use.  See Additional U.S. Rule\rof Interpretation 1(c), HTSUSA.   Accordingly, the liners are\rclassifiable under subheading 6406.99.30, HTSUSA, which provides\rfor parts of footwear, other, of other materials, of rubber or\rplastics.\r\r     We disagree with the statement that the product is more than\r\""part of an upper.\"" It is our view that the merchandise as a\rwhole is  basically a removable liner and its function \""as a sock\rlining\"" does not make it more than a \""part of an upper\"" for\rtariff purposes.   \r\r     GRI 2(b), HTSUSA, provides in part that \""[t]he\rclassification of goods consisting of more than one material or\rsubstance shall be according to the principles of Rule 3.\""   \r\r     GRI 3, HTSUSA, provides as follows: \r\r          3.   When, by application of Rule 2(b) or for any other\r               reason, goods are prima facie classifiable under\r               two or more headings, classification shall be\r               effected as follows: \r\r               (a)  The heading which provides the most specific\r                    description shall be preferred to headings\r                    providing a more general description.  \r                    However, when two or more headings each refer\r                    to part only  of the materials or substances\r                    contained in mixed or composite goods . . .\r                    those headings are to be regarded as equally\r                    specific in relation to those goods, even if\r                    one of them gives a more complete or precise\r                    description of the goods.  \r \r               (b)  Mixtures, composite goods consisting of\r                    different materials or made up of different\r                    components, and goods put up in sets for\r                    retail sale which cannot be classified by\r                    reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if\r                    they consisted of the material or component\r                    which gives them their essential character,\r                    insofar as this criterion is applicable. \r\r     The liners are prima facie classifiable under subheading\r6406.10.9040, HTSUSA, which provides for parts of footwear,\r(including uppers whether or not attached to soles other than\router soles), uppers and parts thereof, other than stiffeners,\rother, other, of man-made fibers or under subheading\r6406.10.6000, HTSUSA, which provides for parts of footwear,      \r(including uppers whether or not attached to soles other than\router soles), other, of rubber or plastics.\r\r     The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System\rExplanatory Notes (EN) to the HTSUSA, although not dispositive\rshould be looked to for the proper interpretation of the HTSUS. \rSee T.D. 89-80, 54 FR 35127 (August 23, 1989).  EN (IX) to GRI\r3(b), at page 4, reads as follows:\r\r     (IX  For the purposes of this Rule, composite\r          goods made up of different components shall\r          be taken to mean not only those in which the\r          components are attached to each other to form\r          a practically inseparable whole but also\r          those with separable components, provided\r          these components are adapted one to the other\r          and are mutually complementary and that\r          together they form a whole which would not\r          normally be offered for sale in separate\r          parts.      \r\r     Clearly, the liners which are composed of textile and\rplastic qualify as composite goods within the purview of GRI\r3(b), HTSUSA.  It is our observation that the essential character\rof the liner is derived from its textile portion noting that\raccording to the information provided, it exceeds the plastic\rportion in value, weight and surface area.  In view of our\rfinding that the essential character of the article is derived\rfrom its textile portion, classification under subheading\r6406.10.9040, HTSUSA, is appropriate. \r\r     Even if it were decided that neither component material\rcould be said to impart the essential character to the\rmerchandise, classification under subheading 6406.10.9040,\rHTSUSA, would be appropriate following GRI 3(c), HTSUSA, which\rstates that \""[w]hen goods cannot be classified by reference to\r3(a) or 3(b), they shall be classified under the heading which\roccurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit\rconsideration.\"" \r\r                            Issue 5 \r\r     One pair of shoe \""frames\"" imported with two or more pairs of\rliners is classifiable as a set under subheading 6402.91.90,\rHTSUSA,  See Headquarters Ruling Letter (HRL) 953219 dated\rFebruary 9, 1993, involving similar merchandise.  The shoe liners\rare not composite goods with the shoe \""frames\"" because both pairs\rof liners cannot be worn at the same time.

Weinberg\rGrunfeld, Desiderio, Lebowitz,\rSilverman & Klestadt LLP\r245 Park Avenue\r33rd Floor\rNew York, New York\r    10167-3397\r\rRe: Pullover or Other Article; Jacket or Similar Garment; Textile and Apparel Guidelines; Apparel Terminology Under the HTSUS; Designed to be Final Layer Garment; Offers Level of Protection From the Elements Provided by Garments of Heading 6101, HTSUS; Polyurethane Coated Lining; Subheading 6101.30.2010, HTSUSA.\r\rDear Ms. Weinberg:\r\r\tThe purpose of this correspondence is to respond to your request dated August 2, 2002.  The correspondence in issue requested, on the behalf of your client, Acushnet Company, a binding classification ruling of the merchandise described by the importer as a “Men’s Performance Fleece Golf Jacket.”\r\r\tThis ruling is being issued subsequent to the following: (1) A review of your submission dated August 2, 2002; (2) An examination of the sample “Dry Joys by <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Joy” “Performance Fleece Pullover,” Style number: 34736, Medium, M100-M, submitted with the ruling request; (3) A review of the marketing literature / hang-tags attached to the sample; (4) A review of the single page of marketing literature provided directly to Customs by Acushnet; (5) An examination of Customs laboratory report dated October 1, 2002; and (6) A telephone conference conducted on October 11, 2002, during which Acushnet was represented by counsel and its apparel vice president.\r\r\rFACTS\r\rThe article in issue, identified as “Dry Joys by <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Joy” “Performance Fleece Pullover,” Style number: 34736, Medium, M100-M, is a men’s upper body garment.\r\rThe outer shell is constructed from a lightweight one hundred percent polyester, finely knit, double-faced fleece fabric.  The fabric is napped on the inside and the outside surfaces.  The garment has a stand-up collar, a partial front opening with a seven (7) inch zipper closure and a covered placket with a snap at the neck.  It is a long-sleeved garment with ribbed cuffs.  The garment has a zippered pocket over the left chest, two slash pockets below the waist that have zipper closures and a tunnel elastic bottom.\r\rThe garment is lined with a one hundred percent nylon knit fabric.  The lining is coated with polyurethane on the inner surface.  Acushnet’s marketing literature advises that the garment is “100 % waterproof.”\r\rOne of the hang-tags describes the garment as composed of “Polartec® 100 Series Fabric” which offers “lightweight warmth with next-to-skin comfort and perspiration management.”  The 100 Series fabrics are “[d]esigned to be the first layer in the Body Climate® System.”  The “100 Series fabrics help maintain an even body temperature during athletic exertion while providing lightweight insulation.”  The other hang-tag specifically notes that the “Performance Fleece Pullover allows for superior function in cool and windy conditions, perfectly suited for the game of golf.”  The second hang-tag identifies the garment as “FJ <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Joy QTRZP PER FLEECE P/O BLK” which translates to: “FJ <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Joy Quarter Zip Performance Fleece Pullover Black.” \r\rISSUE\r\rWhat is the classification, pursuant to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated, of the above-described men’s upper body garment ?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\rThe federal agency responsible for initially interpreting and applying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) is the U.S. Customs Service.\u0002  The Customs Service, in accordance with its legislative mandate, classifies imported merchandise pursuant to the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI) and the Additional U.S. Rules of Interpretation.\u0002\r\rGeneral Rule of Interpretation 1 provides, in part, that classification decisions are to be “determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.” General Rule of Interpretation 1.  General Rule of Interpretation 1 further states that merchandise which cannot be classified in accordance with the dictates of GRI 1 should be classified pursuant to the other General Rules of Interpretation, provided the HTSUSA chapter headings or notes do not require otherwise.  According to the Explanatory Notes (EN), the phrase in GRI 1, “provided such headings or notes do not otherwise require,” is intended to “make it quite clear that the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes are paramount.” General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, Rule 1, Explanatory Note (V).\r\rThe Explanatory Notes constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  See Joint Explanatory Statement supra note 1, at 549.  The Explanatory Notes, although neither legally binding nor dispositive of classification issues, do provide commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS.  The EN’s are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the headings. See T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127-28 (Aug. 23, 1989); Lonza, Inc. v. United States, 46 F. 3rd 1098, 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1995).\r\rThe initial issue confronting the Customs Service in this ruling is the proper identification of the garment as either a jacket or similar garment, or a pullover or similar article.  Counsel for Acushnet suggests that the garment is a jacket and properly classified in heading 6101, HTSUS.  Heading 6101, HTSUS, provides for the classification of “Men’s or boys’ overcoats, carcoats, capes, cloaks, anoraks (including ski-jackets), windbreakers and similar articles, knitted or crocheted, other than those of heading 6103.”  The Explanatory Notes to heading 6101, HTSUS, provide that “[t]his heading covers a category of knitted or crocheted garments for men or boys, characterised by the fact that they are generally worn over all other clothing for protection against the weather.” (Emphasis added).  Explanatory Note 61.01.\r\rThe Customs Service also examined heading 6110, HTSUS.  Heading 6110, HTSUS, provides for the classification of “Sweaters, pullovers, sweatshirts, waistcoats (vests) and similar articles, knitted or crocheted.”  Explanatory Note 61.10 provides that heading 6110, HTSUS, “covers a category of knitted or crocheted articles, without distinction between male or female <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>, designed to cover the upper parts of the body (jerseys, pullovers, cardigans, waistcoats and similar articles).”\r\rThe initial responsibility of the Customs Service is to examine the plain meaning of the statutory text.  See Marcor Dev. Corp. v. United States, 926 F. Supp. 1124, 1129 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1996) citing Trans-Border Customs Services v. United States, 843 F. Supp. 1482, 1485 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1994).  If the plain language of the heading establishes the clear and unambiguous intent of Congress, the classification inquiry at the heading level is complete.  See Id.  The meaning of a tariff term, absent contrary congressional intent, is one that is in accord with its common and popular understanding.  See Carl Zeiss, Inc. v. United States, 195 F. 3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  If the common and popular meaning of a tariff term is not ascertainable from the schedule, Customs may rely on its own understanding of the terms and may consult lexicographic and scientific authorities, dictionaries and other reliable sources.  See generally Precision Specialty Metals, Inc. v. United States, 116 F. Supp. 2d 1350, 1362 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2000).\r\rThe Customs Service, when classifying factually ambiguous or hybrid garments, must initially determine the identity of the garment.  Customs, in doing so, references a number of sources of information.  The primary sources referenced in the preparation of this ruling letter, in addition to the Explanatory Notes, include the Guidelines for the Reporting of Imported Products in Various Textile and Apparel Categories, CIE 13/88 (Nov. 23, 1988) and the Customs Service Informed Compliance Publication (ICP) What Every Member of The Trade Community Should Know About: Apparel Terminology Under the HTSUS (Nov. 2000).\r\rThe Guidelines for the Reporting of Imported Products in Various Textile and Apparel Categories were “developed and revised in accordance with the HTSUSA to ensure uniformity, to facilitate statistical classification, and to assist in the determination of the appropriate textile categories established for the administration of the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles.”  HQ 956982 (Nov. 22, 1994).  The Guidelines are not binding, but do assist Customs and the trade community in distinguishing different classes of garments.  See HQ 956982.\r\rThe Guidelines with regard to determining whether a garment is an “Other coats, men’s and boys’” provide, in pertinent part, the following:\r\rThree-quarter length or longer garments commonly known as coats, and other garments such as…waist length jackets fall within this category….A coat is an outerwear garment which covers either the upper part of the body or both the upper and lower parts of the body….Garments in this category have a full or partial front opening, with or without a means of closure….\r\r*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\r\rC) Shirt-jackets have full or partial front openings and sleeves, and at the least cover the upper body from the neck area to the waist.  They may be within the coat category if designed to be worn over another garment (other than underwear).  The following criteria may be used in determining whether a shirt-jacket is designed for use over another garment, the presence of which is sufficient for its wearer to be considered modestly and conventionally dressed for appearance in public, either indoors or outdoors or both:\r\rFabric weight equal to or exceeding 10 ounces per square yard….\rA full or partial lining.\rPockets at or below the waist.\rBack vents or pleats.  Also side vents in combination with back seams.\rEisenhower styling.\rA belt or simulated belt or elasticized waist on hip length or longer shirt-jackets.\rLarge jacket / coat style buttons, toggles or snaps, a heavy-duty zipper or other heavy-duty closure, or buttons fastened with reinforcing threads for heavy-duty use.\rLapels.\rLong sleeves without cuffs.\rElasticized or rib-knit cuffs.\rDrawstring, elastic or rib-knit waistband.\r\rNote: On knit garments, items 10 and 11 count as one feature.\r\rGarments having features of both jackets and shirts will be categorized as coats if they possess at least three of the above listed features and if the result is not unreasonable.  Many such garments will function as the upper part of leisure suits and will be placed in the categories for “suit-type coats.”… Garments not possessing at least 3 of the listed features will be considered on an individual basis. (Emphasis added).\r\rAcushnet states that the garment is designed to be worn over other outerwear garments, particularly a turtleneck, and suggests that it has more than three of the features associated with jackets set forth in the Guidelines.  Counsel observes that the garment has Guideline features 2, 3, 10 and 11, a lining, pockets at or below the waist, ribbed cuffs and an elastic waistband.  Customs notes that counsel has not accounted for the “Note” at the bottom of the shirt-jacket feature guidelines which states that “On knit garments, items 10 and 11 count as one feature.”  The garment does, however, possess “at least three” of the listed jacket features.  The question that must be addressed is whether designating the garment as a jacket for classification purposes is “ unreasonable” in light of its other features, how it is marketed and how it is worn.  Customs notes that many knit garments have these jacket features and are not designated as jackets. \r\rThe Customs Service further referenced the Informed Compliance Publication What Every Member of The Trade Community Should Know About: Apparel Terminology Under the HTSUS.  The Customs Modernization Act, Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057), obligates the Customs Service to provide the public with improved information concerning the trade community’s rights and responsibilities under the Customs and related laws.  Customs Informed Compliance Publications are one effort to fulfill that responsibility.\r\rThe ICP, Apparel Terminology Under the HTSUS, although provided for general information purposes only, represents the considered thought and expertise of Customs concerning the classification of apparel in Chapters 61 and 62 of the HTSUS.  The definition of “jackets” is under the category for “Anoraks, windbreakers and similar articles (6101, 6102, 6113, 6201, 6202, 6210).” Anoraks, windbreakers, jackets and similar articles, according to the ICP, include:\r \r[j]ackets, which are garments designed to be worn over another garment, for protection against the elements.  Jackets cover the upper body from the neck area to the waist area, but are generally less than mid-thigh length.  They normally have a full front opening, although some jackets may have only a partial front opening.  Jackets usually have long sleeves.  Knit jackets (due to the particular character of knit fabric) generally have tightening elements at the cuffs and at the waist or bottom of the garment, although children’s garments or garments made of heavier material might not need these tightening elements.  This term excludes knit garments that fail to qualify as jackets because they do not provide sufficient protection against the elements.  Such garments, if they have full-front openings, may be considered cardigans of heading 6110 (other). (Emphasis added).\r\r“Pullovers” classifiable in headings 6110 and 6111, HTSUS, according to the ICP, are “upper body knit garments without a full length opening, which are pulled over the head and are not more specifically provided for elsewhere in chapter 61.”\r\rThe principle characteristics of the instant garment relevant to its designation as either a jacket or a pullover are: (1) Whether the garment is an “outerwear garment” “generally worn over all other clothing for protection against the weather;” and (2) Whether the level of protection from the elements afforded by the garment rises to that provided by the garments designated eo nomine in heading 6101, HTSUS.  Guidelines; Explanatory Note 61.01.  See also Apparel Terminology Under the HTSUS.  It is the determination of the Customs Service that the Acushnet garment will generally be the wearer’s final outer garment and that the level of protection from the weather offered by the garment, primarily because of the polyurethane coated lining, rises to the level of warmth and protection afforded by garments of heading 6101, HTSUS.  The Acushnet garment is, therefore, a “jacket.”\r\rSignificant to Customs determination in this matter is the fact that the garment has a lining that is coated with polyurethane.  The lining alone is not determinative, but the fact that the lining is coated with polyurethane is most significant.  The polyurethane coating on the lining of this garment adds an additional degree of protection from the elements that results in the level of weather protection rising to the level associated with garments of heading 6101, HTSUS.  Although the Acushnet garment is similar in outward appearance to “pullovers” of heading 6110, HTSUS, the polyurethane coated lining results in a different garment, one that will be worn differently from similarly appearing garments that have no linings or only have non-coated linings.\r\rCustoms technical expert, the National Import Specialist of the National Commodity Specialist Division, advises this office that knit, half-zip garments, are distinct articles of commerce unique to knitwear and are understood within the apparel trade as “pullovers.”  This office, valuing the technical expertise of the National Import Specialist, appreciates the fact that knit, half-zip garments are generally known as “pullovers.”  This office only designates the Acushnet garment a “jacket” because the polyurethane-coated lining raises the level of weather protection afforded by the garment to that of heading 6101, HTSUS, garments and also alters the manner in which the garment will be worn.\r\r\tThe Acushnet garment, like overcoats, carcoats, capes, cloaks, anoraks, ski-jackets and windbreakers that are “generally worn over all other clothing for protection against the weather,” is designed to be the wearer’s final layer of clothing protection from the elements.  See Explanatory Note 61.01.  The Acushnet garment, similar to the garments designated eo nomine, that is by name, in heading 6101, HTSUS, will not likely be worn under another garment.  Although the “Performance Fleece Pullover” may be worn next to the skin, as its lining is comfortable to the touch and the lining seams are finished in a manner that the garment would be comfortable, it is the conclusion of this office that such use would be fugitive.\r\rThe Customs Service decision to differentiate garments of heading 6101, HTSUS, from garments of heading 6110, HTSUS, on the basis of how the garments are worn is in conformity with the Explanatory Notes, the Guidelines and the Apparel Terminology Under the HTSUS Informed Compliance Publication.  Jackets are outdoor garments because of the level of weather protection offered and the manner in which they are worn.  Jackets offer greater warmth and protection from the elements than pullovers, will generally not be worn indoors and are usually the final garment of protection against the elements.  See HQ 964203 (Dec. 4, 2000).\r\rThe Acushnet garment, in comparison to the garments enumerated in heading 6101, HTSUS, affords a comparable level of protection from the weather.  Customs is aware that the fabric weight of the outer shell, according to Customs laboratory report, is only 5.12 ounces per square yard.  This is significantly below the 10 ounces per square yard set forth as feature 1 in the Guidelines.  Customs does not consider this fact alone definitive because it does not take into consideration the garment’s inner polyurethane-coated lining.  The polyurethane coated lining of the instant garment provides the entire garment with a higher level of protection from the elements.\r\rIt is the determination of the Customs Service, based on the above analysis, that the “Dry Joys by <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Joy” “Performance Fleece Pullover” is a “jacket.”  It would not be “unreasonable,” utilizing the language of the Guidelines, to designate the garment a jacket.  The garment is more accurately described as a “jacket” by the reasoning set forth in the Explanatory Notes, the Guidelines and the Informed Compliance Publication.  The men’s upper body garment is, for the purposes of classification pursuant to GRI 1, a garment similar to those properly classified in heading 6101, HTSUS.  Heading 6101, HTSUS, provides for the classification of “Men’s or boys’ overcoats, carcoats, capes, cloaks, anoraks (including ski-jackets), windbreakers and similar articles, knitted or crocheted, other than those of heading 6103.”\r\rContinuing the classification of the Acushnet “Performance Fleece Pullover,” the garment is classified in subheading 6101.30.2010, HTSUSA.  Subheading 6101.30.2010, HTSUSA, provides for:\r\rMen’s or boys’ overcoats, carcoats, capes, cloaks, anoraks (including ski-jackets), windbreakers and similar articles, knitted or crocheted, other than those of heading 6103:\r\rOf man-made fibers:\r\r    Other:\rOther,\r\r6101.30.2010     Men’s.\r\rThe Customs Service notes, with regard to classifying the Acushnet garment, the applicability of Chapter 61, Note 9, HTSUS.  Note 9 provides:\r\rGarments of this chapter designed for left over right closure at the front shall be regarded as men’s or boys’ garments, and those designed for right over left closure at the front as women’s or girls’ garments.  These provisions do not apply where the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for one or the other of the sexes.\r\rGarments which cannot be identified as either men’s or boys’ garments or as women’s or girls’ garments are to be classified in the headings covering women’s or girls’ garments. Chapter 61, Note 9, HTSUS.\r\r\tThe cut of the Acushnet garment clearly indicates that it is designed to be worn by men.  Since the garment is designed for men or boys, it is classified at the subheading level, pursuant to GRI 1, in subheading 6101.30.2010, HTSUSA.\r\rHOLDING\r\r\tThe “Dry Joys by <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Joy” “Performance Fleece Pullover,” Style number: 34736, Medium, M100-M, is classified in subheading 6101.30.2010, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated.\r\rThe General Column 1 Rate of Duty is twenty eight and six-tenths (28.6) percent, ad valorem.\r\rThe textile quota category is 634.\r\rThe designated textile and apparel category may be subdivided into parts.  If subdivided, the quota and visa requirements applicable to the subject merchandise may be affected.  Since part categories are the result of international bilateral agreements which are subject to frequent negotiations and changes, to obtain the most current information available, we suggest your client check, close to the time of shipment, the Status Report On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels) an internal issuance of the U.S. Customs Service which is updated weekly and is available for inspection at the local Customs Service office.  The Status Report On Current Import Quotas (Restraint Levels) is also available on the Customs Electronic Bulletin Board (CEBB) which can be found on the U.S. Customs Web site at www.customs.gov.\r\rDue to the changeable nature of the statistical annotation (the ninth and tenth digits of the classification) and the restraint (quota/visa) categories, your client \r\rshould contact the local Customs office prior to importation of this merchandise to determine the current status of any import restraints or requirements.\r\r\t\t\t\t\tSincerely,\r\r\r\r\t\t\t\t\tMyles B.

Farrow, Ltd.\r475A Admiral Blvd.\rMississauga, L5T 2N1\rCanada\r\r\rRE:\tThe tariff classification of footwear insoles from Canada\r\u000BDear Ms. Long:\r\rIn your letters dated April 11, 2022, and June 1, 2022,  you requested a tariff classification ruling on behalf of your client, Orpyx Medical Technologies, Inc. You have submitted descriptive literature, diagrams, photographs, and marketing materials for two styles of footwear insoles.  No samples were submitted with your request. \r\rThe Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles and Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles are removable footwear insoles available to men and women in a full complement of shoe sizes. In your correspondence, you state the insoles are not available in retail establishments and are targeted to patients of podiatrists.  The Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles are constructed in three layers and the Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles, which might be prescribed for those needing additional <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> support, are constructed with an additional foam layer that can be molded.  The base layer of both versions is composed of Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) to provide durability.  The next layer incorporates the OSI Sensory System consisting of multiple pressure and temperature sensors (27-37 sensors depending upon insole size), 6-axis IMUs that utilize accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc., and Cellular and Bluetooth transmitters.  The top foam layers consist of rubber/plastics such as EVA and polyurethane covered with a microfiber lining.  The insoles are packed with charging wires, enabling a weekly or biweekly charge.\r\rWhen the insoles are worn, both versions collect physiologic data such as <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span>-time, pressure, step count, orientation, and temperature while the user performs their daily activities.  The data analytics gathered is transmitted via cellular and Bluetooth™ technology to the internet.  Data patterns can be accessed and monitored by phone, tablet, computer, etc., by the wearer and medical professionals with the goal of effective decision-making regarding designing care plans to manage, and to possibly prevent, diabetic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> ulcers and other <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> problems.\r\rIn your letter, you suggest that the Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles and Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles are classified under subheading 9021.10.0090, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), as orthopedic appliances.  We disagree.  Note (6) to Chapter 90 states “[f]or the purposes of heading 9021 … [o]rthopedic appliances include footwear and special insoles designed to correct orthopedic conditions, provided that they are either (1) made to measure or (2) mass-produced, entered singly and not in pairs and designed to fit either <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> equally.”  In this case, both types of insoles help individuals, who may or may not have a pre-existing diabetic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> ulcer, to manage and prevent diabetic <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> ulcers.  They are not designed to correct orthopedic conditions.  In addition, the Flex Sensory Insoles are mass produced, presented in pairs, and made in left and right configurations that are not designed to fit either <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> equally.  Although one of the foam layers of the Custom Sensory Insoles can be modified to accommodate various special requirements such as depressions for offloading and may be considered made to measure, they do not correct orthopedic conditions.  As such, they will not be classified in heading 9021, HTSUS.\r\rThe applicable subheading for the Orpyx SI® Flex Sensory Insoles and Orpyx SI® Custom Sensory Insoles will be 6406.90.3060, HTSUS, which provides for parts of footwear; other: removable insoles, heel cushions and similar articles; of rubber or plastics; other.  The rate of duty will be 5.3 percent ad valorem. \r\rDuty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change.  The text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on World Wide Web at https://hts.usitc.gov/current.\r\rThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rA copy of the ruling or the control number indicated above should be provided with the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

Box 129\rColumbus, OH 43216\r\rRe:  Country of origin marking of articles imported in unsealed\r     disposable retail containers\r\rDear Mr. Burrell:\r\r     This is in reply to your September 1, 1989, letter request-\ring a ruling on country of origin marking requirements for <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>-\r<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> imported into the U.S. in plastic packaging.\r\rFACTS:\r\r     The sample submitted consists of a pair of slippers packaged\rin an unsealed translucent, colorless plastic bag with a plastic\rhandle and hook at the top and a snap opening on the back.  The\rslippers may be viewed while in the package or by unsnapping the\rbag and removing them.  On the front of the bag is the printed\rphrase \""Sold by 'Sears, Roebuck and Co.', Chicago, IL 69684.\""\rExamination of the article itself reveals a pair of woman's house\rslippers made of a fabric upper and a hard rubber sole.  The sole\rof each slipper is marked \""Handcrafted in Mexico from U.S.\rMaterials\"" directly above washing instructions and the size\rmarking.  Both the fabric upper and the rubber sole are\rdistinctly the products of separate manufacturing processes using\rmachinery.  In particular, the fabric upper appears to consist\rof, primarily, an outer layer of terry cloth.  This outer layer\ris uniformly stitched to an inner layer of fabric.  The sole is\rplainly the product of a molding process, injection or otherwise.\rThe upper and lower are combined by, at a minimum, stitching that\rmust drive a threaded needle through not only two layers of\rfabric but an approximate 0.125 inch thick piece of hard rubber,\rand the stitching is uniform in length and location within the\rentire perimeter of the sole.\r\r\r\r\r\rISSUES:\r\r     a) Is the country of origin marking on the bottom of the\rslippers acceptable, or must the country of origin be reprinted\ron the bag; b) is the language \""Handcrafted in Mexico from U.S.\rMaterials\"" acceptable marking?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     a)  Section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19\rU.S.C. 1304), provides that every article of foreign origin (or\rits container) imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a con-\rspicuous place as legibly, indelibly and permanently as the na-\rture of the article (or container) will permit, in such a manner\ras to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the U.S. the English\rname of the country of origin of the article.  The primary pur-\rpose of the country of origin marking statute is to \""mark the\rgoods so that at the time of purchase the ultimate purchaser may,\rby knowing where the goods were produced, be able to buy or\rrefuse to buy the product, if such marking should influence his\rwill.\"" United States v. Friedlaender & Co., 27 CCPA 297 (1940);\rNational Juice Products Association v. United States, 10 CIT 48\r(1986).\r\r     Part 134, Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 134) implements\rthe statutory country of origin marking requirements.  Pursuant\rto 19 CFR 134.24(d)(3), if the article is in an unsealed dispos-\rable container that is normally opened by the ultimate purchaser\rprior to purchase, only the article need be marked.\r\r     Customs finds that the submitted sample consists of a con-\rtainer that normally would be opened by the ultimate purchaser,\rsince it is easily snapped open and shut, thereby enabling the\rultimate purchaser to remove the article for closer examination.\rAlthough in such circumstances generally only the article must be\rmarked to indicate its country of origin, this is not the case\rwhere a U.S. address is on the container.\r\r     Pursuant to 19 CFR 134.46, in any case in which the name of\rany city in the U.S. appears on an imported article or its\rcontainer, there shall appear, legibly and permanently, in close\rproximity to such name, and in at least a comparable size, the\rname of the country of origin preceded by \""Made in,\"" \""Product\rof,\"" or other words of similar meaning.  In view of the U.S.\raddress printed on the sample container, the requirements of this\rsection apply.  Since the country of origin marking on the bottom\rof the slippers is not in close proximity to the U.S. address,\ranother country of origin marking which meets the requirements of\r19 CFR 134.46 must appear on the bag.\r\r\r\r     b)   Although Customs has ruled that \""Handcrafted in Mexico\""\rsufficiently indicated the country of origin of a product, see\rHeadquarters Ruling Letter HQ 732689, December 7, 1989, the lan-\rguage must be accurate.  Section 11.13, Customs Regulations (19\rCFR 11.13), provides that articles (or their containers) which\rbear false designations of origin, or false descriptions or\rrepresentations, including words or other symbols tending false-\rly to describe or represent the articles, are prohibited impor-\rtation under 15 U.S.C. 1124, 1125 and other provisions of law,\rand shall be detained.\r\r     We find certain regulations of the Indian Arts and Crafts\rBoard concerning the use of certificates identifying genuine\rhandicrafts to be instructive in determining if the use of the\rword \""handcrafted\"" is accurate in this case.  One of the condi-\rtions of eligibility for the attachment of such a certificate is\rthat the object be produced by Indian craftsmen \""with the help of\ronly such devices as allow the manual skill of the maker to\rcondition the shape and design of each individual product,\"" 25\rCFR 308.3a.\r\r     Customs finds that the word \""Handcrafted\"" tends falsely to\rdescribe the article.  Both the upper and sole are clearly the\rproducts of separate manufacturing processes using machinery.\rThe uniform stitching of the outer layer of the upper to the in-\rner layer does not present an article that is fashioned chiefly\rby hand.  The sole is plainly the product of a molding process,\rinjection or otherwise.  The upper and lower are combined by\rstitching that is uniform in length and location within the en-\rtire perimeter of the sole of each slipper.  On the whole, we\rfind that the article is not fashioned totally or chiefly by\rhand, especially with manual skill, even though skilled labor may\rbe employed in operating the machinery that makes the components\rand combines them into the finished article.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r     Imported house slippers packaged in an unsealed disposable\rcontainer that is normally opened by the ultimate purchaser\rprior to purchase must be marked to indicate their country of\rorigin.  Where the name of a U.S. city appears on such packag-\ring, the packaging also must be marked \""Made in [country],\"" or\r\""Product of [country],\"" or other words of similar meaning.\r\r\r\r\r     For purposes of this ruling only, \""Handcrafted\"" tends\rfalsely to describe or represent the article, and is, therefore,\rnot in compliance with the marking requirements of 19 CFR 11.13.\r\r                                   Sincerely,\r\r\r\r\r                                   Marvin M.

The protest is against U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) classification and liquidation of the Instride® Advantage™ Dual Purpose Ankle <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Gauntlet under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).\r\rFACTS:\r\r\tThe merchandise that is the subject of this protest is identified as the Instride® Ankle <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Gauntlet.  It consists of a textile (neoprene) upper that covers the wearer’s forefoot, ankle, and toes.  The separately applied outer sole is constructed from the same textile/neoprene material but it is covered with a rubber/plastic application.  CBP Laboratory and Scientific Services Report Number NY20051854, dated March 22, 2006, indicates that the product consists of 61.3% textile materials and 38.7% rubber or plastic materials.  The product is secured to the user’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by a Velcro™ connection around the ankle.  The heel is completely open.  A picture of the merchandise follows. \u0002\r\r\u0001\r\r\tThe protestant made six entries of the subject merchandise through your port between May 13, 2005 and December 10, 2005 under heading 6115, HTSUS, which provides for footwear without applied soles, stockings and other hosiery, including those for varicose veins.  On August 24, 2006, you issued a Request for Information (CBP Form 28) requesting that the importer submit written information from a prior meeting along with other procedural information.  The entries were liquidated on June 30, 2006 and July 7, 2006 under heading 6404, HTSUS, which provides for footwear with outer soles of leather, plastics, or rubber and uppers of textiles.  The protestant then filed a protest on these six entries on August 9, 2006, arguing for classification in heading 6307, HTSUS, which provides for other made-up articles of textiles.\r\rISSUE:\r\r\tWhether the subject merchandise is classifiable in heading 6307, HTSUS, as other made up articles of textiles or as footwear in heading 6404, HTSUS, as footwear with uppers of textiles and outer soles of plastic or rubber?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r\tInitially, we note that this matter is protestable as a classification decision pursuant to 19 U.S.C. §1514(a)(2).  The protest was timely filed on August 9, 2006, within 180 days of the liquidation of the first entry giving rise to the protest.  See Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2004, Pub.L. 108-429, §2103(2)(B)(ii),(iii) (codified as amended at 19 U.S.C. §1514(c)(3) (2006)).  \r\r\tFurther review of Protest 4701-06-100549 was properly accorded because the port’s decision is alleged to be inconsistent with a ruling on the same or substantially similar merchandise.  See 19 C.F.R. §174.24(a).  Specifically, the protestant cites New York Ruling Letter (NY) K89724, dated September 30, 2004; NY L80096, dated October 12, 2004; and NY L85138, dated May 26, 2005, which classified various ankle support products in heading 6307, HTSUS.\r\r\tClassification under the HTSUS is made in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 may then be applied in order.  \r\r\tThe 2005 HTSUS provisions under consideration are:\r\r6307\tOther made up articles, including dress patterns:\r\r6404\tFootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials:\r\r\tChapter 64, Note 1, HTSUS, provides in relevant part (emphasis added):\r\r\tThis chapter does not cover:\r\r(b)\tFootwear of textile material, without an outer sole glued, sewn or otherwise affixed or applied to the upper (section XI)\r\rChapter 64, Note 4, HTSUS, provides in relevant part:\r\rSubject to note 3 to this chapter:\r\r(b)\tThe constituent material of the outer sole shall be taken to be the material having the greatest surface area in contact with the ground, no account being taken of accessories or reinforcements such as spikes, bars, nails, protectors or similar attachments.\r\r\tThe term “outer sole” is defined in the Explanatory Note (EN) to Section XII (which includes heading 6404, HTSUS).\u0002  EN (C) provides:  “[t]he term ‘outer sole’ as used in headings 64.01 to 64.05 means that part of the footwear (other than an attached heel) which, when in use, is in contact with the ground.”  \r\r\tCBP has determined that the test on whether or not a product has an outer sole that has been affixed to the product is whether or not there is a “line of demarcation” between the upper and the outer sole such that the outer sole is a completely separate component prior to its application to the upper.  See Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 967659, dated July 1, 2005; HQ 967851, dated November 18, 2005; and HQ 956921, dated November 22, 1994.  In particular the “line of demarcation” has been defined as “the line along which the sole ends and the upper begins.”  See Treasury Decision (T.D.) 93-88 (27 Cust. Bull. & Dec. 46), dated October 25, 1993.  In addition, the product must not be designed to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> inside other footwear.  Id.\r\r\tApplying these definitions to the present merchandise, the product consists of two pieces of material that are sewn together with a strip of material covering the seam.  The seam is located on the edges where the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> would touch the ground.  In addition, this office was able to completely unstitch the piece of material that would come in contact with the ground.  We believe that this product does have a line of demarcation indicating there is a separate piece of textile material that touches the ground.  The seam is the line of demarcation and the ability to separate the two components is a clear indication that there is a separately applied outer sole.  The separate piece of material is the outer sole of the footwear because this piece of material is the portion of the product that will come in contact with the ground.  Thus, this product cannot be excluded from classification in Chapter 64, HTSUS, because it has a separately applied outer sole.  Furthermore, the plastic is the material having the greatest surface area in contact with the ground because the applied outer sole is completely covered in plastic.  Therefore, classification in heading 6404, HTSUS, is appropriate.\r\r\tFinally, in your submission you contend that the product is similar to the products in New York Ruling Letters (NY) K89724, dated September 30, 2004; L80096, dated October 12, 2004; and L85138, dated May 26, 2005.  The product that was the subject of NY L85138 was a textile ankle wrap that was a single piece of textile material that the user simply wrapped around their ankle.  In response to this protest, this office, requested and reviewed the files for NY K89724 and L80096 to determine if the products were substantially similar to the product that is the subject of this protest.  Based on our review of both of these files we are unable to determine whether or not this product is substantially similar to the product before us.  Since we are unable to determine whether or not these rulings describe substantially similar products we believe that the protestant cannot rely on these rulings when classifying its merchandise.  Thus, none of these rulings are controlling in this case.\r\rHOLDING:\r\r\tBy application of GRI 1, the Instride Ankle <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span> Gauntlet is classified in heading 6404, HTSUS, more specifically, it is classified in subheading 6404.19.3580, HTSUSA, which provides for “[f]ootwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of textile materials: [o]ther: [f]ootwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the slip-on type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing except footwear of subheading 6404.19.20 and except <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> having a foxing or foxing like band wholly or almost wholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole and overlapping the upper: [o]ther… [o]ther: [o]ther…”  The 2005 column one, general rate of duty, is 37.5% ad valorem. \r\rYou are instructed to DENY the protest.  In accordance with Sections IV and VI of the CBP Protest/Petition Processing Handbook (HB 3500-08A, December 2007, pp. 24 and 26), you are to mail this decision, together with the CBP Form 19, to the protestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter.  Any reliquidation of the entry or entries in accordance with the decision must be accomplished prior to mailing the decision.\r\rSixty days from the date of the decision, the Office International Trade, Regulations and Rulings, will make the decision available to CBP personnel, and to the public on the CBP Home Page on the World Wide Web at www.CBP.gov, by means of the Freedom of Information Act, and other methods of public distribution.\r\r\r\tSincerely,\r\r\r\r\r\tMyles B.

The entry indicated that the vessel underwent foreign\rshipyard work while in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.\r\r     An application for relief was filed by the vessel operator\rin which it was claimed that certain items were not subject to\rduty as modifications to the vessel or as a casualty resulting\rfrom the collision of the vessel. This office allowed in part and\rdenied in part the application for relief.  Headquarters Ruling\rLetter 111293, dated September 5, 1991.  The vessel owner has\rsupplied further information and explanation on certain items\rthat we previously denied and petitions for review of these\ritems.\r\rISSUE:\r\r     (1)  Whether the foreign shipyard work described herein\rwould constitute modifications to the hull and fittings so as to\rrender the work nondutiable under 19 U.S.C. 1466.\r\r     (2)  Whether the damage resulting from the collision of the\rvessel impaired the safety and seaworthiness of the vessel.\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rI.   Modifications to the Vessel.\r\r     Title 19, United States Code, section 1466, provides in\rpertinent part for payment of an ad valorem duty of fifty percent\rof the cost of foreign repairs to or equipment purchased for a\rvessel documented under the laws of the United States to engage\rin the foreign or coastwise trade.\r\r     In its application of the vessel repair statute, Customs has\rheld that modifications to the hull and fittings of a vessel are\rnot subject to vessel repair duties.  Over the course of years,\rthe identification of modification processes has evolved from\rjudicial and administrative precedent.  In considering whether an\roperation has resulted in a modification which is not subject to\rduty, the following elements may be considered.\r\r1.  Whether there is a permanent incorporation into the hull or\rsuperstructure of a vessel (see United States v. Admiral Oriental\rLine et al., T.D. 44359 (1930)), either in a structural sense or\ras demonstrated by the means of attachment so as to be indicative\rof the intent to be permanently incorporated.  This element\rshould not be given undue weight in view of the fact that vessel\rcomponents must be welded or otherwise \""permanently attached\"" to\rthe ship as a result of constant pitching and rolling.  In\raddition, some items, the cost of which is clearly dutiable,\rinteract with other vessel components resulting in the need,\rpossibly for that purpose alone, for a fixed and stable\rjuxtaposition of vessel parts.  It follows that a \""permanent\rattachment\"" takes place that does not necessarily involve a\rmodification to the hull and fittings.\r\r2.  Whether in all likelihood, an item under consideration would\rremain aboard a vessel during an extended lay up.\r\r3.  Whether, if not a first time installation, an item under\rconsideration replaces a current part, fitting or structure which\ris not in good working order.\r\r4.  Whether an item under consideration provides an improvement\ror enhancement in operation or efficiency of the vessel\r\r     Very often when considering whether an addition to the hull\rand fittings took place for the purpose of 19 U.S.C. 1466, we\rhave considered the question from the standpoint of whether the\rwork involved the purchase of \""equipment\"" for the vessel.  It is\rnot possible to compile a complete list of items that might be\raboard a ship that constitute its \""equipment\"".  An unavoidable\rproblem in that regard stems from the fact that vessels differ as\rto their services.  What is required equipment on a large\rpassenger vessel might not be required on a fish processing\rvessel or offshore rig.\r\r     \""Dutiable equipment\"" has been defined to include:\r\r          ...portable articles necessary or appropriate\r          for the navigation, operation, or maintenance\r          of a vessel, by not permanently incorporated\r          in or permanently attached to its hull or\r          propelling machinery, and not constituting\r          consumable supplies.  Admiral Oriental,\r          supra., (quoting T.D. 34150, (1914))\r\r     By defining what articles are considered to be equipment,\rthe Court attempted to formulate criteria to distinguish non-\rdutiable items which are part of the hull and fittings of a\rvessel from dutiable equipment, as defined above.  These items\rmight be considered to include:\r\r          ...those appliances which are permanently\r          attached to the vessel, and which would\r          remain on board were the vessel to be laid\r          up for a long period...  Admiral Oriental,\r          supra., (quoting 27 Op. Atty. Gen. 228).\r\r     A more contemporary working definition might be that which\ris used under certain circumstances by the Coast Guard; it\rincludes a system, accessory, component or appurtenance of a\rvessel.  This would include navigational, radio, safety and,\rordinarily, propulsion machinery.\r\r     After reviewing the evidence regarding the specific items\rsubmitted for our consideration, we find the following:\r\r     MHI Invoice 14 A, Item No. 3-1-10: Upper Pintle Inspection\rCover:\r\r          The invoice description and the additional drawings\r          submitted by the petitioner indicate that the rudder\r          access plate was modified by installing hinges and a\r          locking mechanism.  This modification will permit\r          easier access for inspection of the rudder and pintle.\r          This work represents a new design feature, and we\r          conclude that the cost of the operation is not subject\r          to duty.\r\r     MHI Invoice 14 A, Item No. A-9:  Chain Locker Eductor Pipe:\r\r          The invoice description of this item indicates that a\r          clogged eductor pipe was cleaned out.  Such work\r          constitutes a dutiable repair.  The invoice indicates\r          that work was also performed to permanently correct the\r          persistent clogging of the eductor pipe.  This\r          operation would have qualified as a non-dutiable\r          modification had the costs of the repairs and the\r          modification been segregated.  Absent such segregation,\r          the entire cost is dutiable.\r\r     MHI Invoice Item ADD. 5 A & B: Cargo Securing Boxes:\r\r          The invoice indicates that boxes were constructed and\r          installed to hold cargo securing gear.  While these\r          boxes are similar to boxes already on the vessel, these\r          boxes do not replace the existing boxes.  The\r          installation constitutes a new design feature and is\r          not dutiable.\r\r     MHI Invoice 17, Item 17:  Paint Locker:\r\r          The existing paint locker was divided into two rooms\r          through the addition of a division bulkhead and a\r          separate entrance.  This partition did not previously\r          exist and represents a new design.  The cost for this\r          modification is not dutiable.\r\rII.  Damage Resulting from the Collision of the Vessel.\r\r     The vessel repair statute provides for the remission of\rduties in those instances where good and sufficient evidence is\rfurnished to show that foreign repairs were compelled by \""stress\rof weather or other casualty\"" and were necessary to secure the\rsafety and seaworthiness of the vessel to enable her to reach her\rport of destination.  19 U.S.C. 1466(d)(1).  The term casualty,\ras it is used in the statute, has been interpreted as something\rthat, like stress of weather, comes with unexpected force or\rviolence, such as fire, explosion, or collision.  Dollar\rSteamship Lines, Inc. v. United States, 5 Cust. Ct. 23, 28-29,\rC.D. 362 (1940).  In the absence of evidence of such a casualty\rcausing event, we must consider the repair to have been\rnecessitated by normal <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and tear.  C.S.D. 89-95, 23 Cust. B.\r& Dec., No. 43, 4, 5 (1989).\r\r     In ruling on the application, we determined that a casualty\rhad occurred, but that the evidence presented did not enable us\rto infer that the damage--a six-<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> long, two to three inch deep\rgouge in the shear strake--impaired the safety and seaworthiness\rof the vessel.  As part of the petition, the petitioner included\ran explanation from Sea-Land's General Manager, Fleet\rEngineering, regarding the need for immediate repairs.  The\rGeneral Manager stated that the shear strake is a critical\rstrength member of the hull and requires immediate attention when\rdamaged.  With such damage, he stated that it is not recommended\rthat a vessel proceed on a trans-Pacific winter crossing.  These\rconclusions are supported by the recommendation of the American\rBureau of Shipping that the sheer strake plate be cropped and\rpartly renewed with a new seam and new butts at the gouge.  Based\ron this information, we conclude that the repairs made to the\rshear strake were necessary to secure the safety and\rseaworthiness of the vessel to enable her to reach her port of\rdestination. The duty paid on the cost of such repairs may\rtherefore be remitted.\r\rHOLDINGS:\r\r     (1)  We find that certain work, as detailed in our analysis\rabove, constitutes modifications to the vessel, the cost of which\ris not subject to duty under 19 U.S.C. 1466.\r\r     (2)  From the information presented, we conclude that the\rrepairs made to the shear strake were necessary to secure the\rsafety and seaworthiness of the vessel to enable her to reach her\rport of destination. The duty paid on the cost of such repairs\rmay therefore be remitted.\r\r\r                              Sincerely,\r\r\r\r                              B.

You continue, “The upper is man made fiber and covers the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> from just forward of the instep to the heel. The two sides of the upper open wide to allow the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> to be set down on the shoe without bending.  The sides of the upper are secured by man made fiber straps threaded through plastic D-rings.  The straps have hook and loop closures.  The merchandise is imported in single units, not pairs”.\r\r\tFrom our examination, we note that the sample is symmetrical down its long axis, i.e., it is neither a “left” nor a “right”.  Also, it is not labeled with a shoe size, but “WM”, which we take to be Women’s Medium.  Both of these facts support your claims\rthat they will be imported in single units and that they will be worn only following <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> injury or surgery, routinely via a physician’s prescription.   \r\r\tAs you have noted, the Notice published in the Customs Bulletin of March 18, 1998, proposing, in essence, to change the classification of similar items from HTS 9021 to HTS 6404 after a Change of Practice Notice in the Federal Register, has not led to any such Change of Practice.  Therefore, the previous rulings you cite do presently remain in effect.  Although the .7 inch thick outer sole in your sample is somewhat more flexible than the one in the ruling you cite because of significant thinning in the mid-<span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> along both sides, we agree it is still unusually rigid enough to ensure that it would be almost impossible to walk in a pair of them.  The upper is almost identical. \r\r\tWe also note that the reason given in the CB Notice of January 7, 1998 for the underlying classification change was a classification decision made in March of 1996 by the Harmonized System Committee of the World Customs Organization.  That decision was contrary to the previous rulings by U.S. Customs on similar items and the recommendation by NIS J. Sheridan, then assigned footwear in this Division, concerning the sample before them.  We note that, in the interim, the HSC-WCO has apparently had second thoughts in this area.  Per HSC-WCO document NG0017B1, a new chapter note is scheduled to be inserted in the Harmonized System as of January 1, 2002, which will state, “Orthopaedic appliances include footwear...mass-produced, presented singly and not in pairs and designed to fit either <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> equally”.  Of course, the United States will be obliged then to incorporate that Note into the HTS, assuming it goes into effect as planned. This would, of course, make moot the change of classification under the current HTS of future importations of items, like yours, which meet the new language.    \r\r\tThe applicable subheading for this footwear will be 9021.19.85.00, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for “other” orthopedic or fracture appliances.  The duty rate will be free.\r\r\tThis ruling is being issued under the provisions of Section 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. 177).\r\r\tA copy of this ruling letter or the control number indicated above should be attached to the entry documents filed at the time this merchandise is imported.

"{""text"":""\r\rHQ 963517\r\rJanuary 2, 2002\r\r\rCLA-2  RR:CR:TE  963517 SS\r\rCATEGORY:  Classification\r\rTARIFF NO.: 6115.12.1000, 6115.93.3000, 6115.93.9020\r\rPort Director\rU. S. Customs Service\r700 Doug Davis Drive\rAtlanta, GA 30354\r\rRE:\tDecision on Application for Further Review of Protest 1704-99-100314; Classification of Graduated Compression Panty Hose and Stockings; Classification of Anti-Embolism Stockings\r\rDear Port Director:\r\rThis is in response to the Application for Further Review of Protest Number 1704-99-100314 filed by the importer, MediUSA L.P., contesting the classification of graduated compression panty hose and stockings and anti-embolism stockings which you forwarded to our office for review on November 22, 1999.  The Protestant disagrees with the decision of the port to liquidate the subject merchandise under subheadings 6115.12.2000 and 6115.93.9020, HTSUSA, as other panty hose or stockings.  The Protestant claims that the merchandise was properly classified as entered under subheadings 6115.12.1000 and 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA, as surgical panty hose or stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\r\rThe Application for Further Review of Protest was timely filed and is proper pursuant to Part 174 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 174).\r\rFACTS:\r\rThere are two classes of merchandise under protest.  The first class is graduated compression panty hose and stockings.  The hosiery is designed to supply graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg.\u0002  They are knit from 71–75 percent nylon and 25-29 percent spandex.  The importer describes the hosiery as being made of a heavyweight fabric and having the appearance of traditional medical stockings.  The hosiery is available in multiple sizes and styles.  The products are packaged and sold by prescription as part of a line of hosiery with graduated compression which ranges from 20 to 50 mm Hg.  The hosiery is sold through medical supply houses and similar places by professionals skilled in fitting these stockings.  \r\rThe second class of merchandise is described by the importer as anti-embolism stockings.  These stockings have a compression of 18 mm Hg.  The compression supplied is not graduated.  The importer claims that the stockings are designed to be worn by recumbent patients in the hospital in order to reduce the risk of developing an embolism.  The stockings are not prescribed by a doctor.  There was no evidence submitted that a patient must be measured by specially trained personnel in order to ensure a proper fit.\r\rThe port reclassified the articles as other panty hose and stockings based on the belief that articles with less than 30 mm Hg of compression did not supply sufficient compression for orthopedic treatment and that the anti-embolism stockings were not prescribed by a physician. \r\rISSUE:\r\rI.\tWhat is the proper classification of graduated compression panty hose and stockings under the HTSUSA?\r\rII.\tWhat is the proper classification of the anti-embolism stockings under the HTSUSA?\r\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.  Merchandise that cannot be classified in accordance with GRI 1 is to be classified in accordance with subsequent GRI taken in order.  The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN), constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the EN provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.\r\rIt is undisputed that these products are classified under heading 6115, HTSUSA, as “panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted.”  The products are of synthetic fibers and it is assumed for the purposes of this ruling that the yarns measure 67 decitex or more.  The only issue in this case is whether the items are considered surgical panty hose or stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment within the scope of subheadings 6115.12.1000 and 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA.\r\rI.\tGraduated Compression Panty Hose and Stockings\r\r\tUnder the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), surgical support stockings were classified as orthopedic appliances.  In Treasury Decision (T.D.) 76-133, Customs offered the following description of surgical stockings:\r\r\tFor tariff classification purposes, a surgical stocking is a leg and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> covering which is made from a heavy gauge, opaque, elasticized fabric with either a one or two-way stretch, and which is worn as a remedial support of the leg.  It is designed for use in post-surgical support and in the treatment of thrombophlebitis, varicosities, edema, and other physical ailments, and is sold either singly or in pairs.  It is not the type of merchandise commonly known as support hose which can be purchased in a variety of retail stores.  Surgical stockings are usually obtained at the direction of a physician at certain medical supply outlets which have personnel specially trained to measure and fit the merchandise to the legs of each individual patient.\r\rThe graduated compression panty hose and stockings at issue meet this general description of surgical stockings. \r\r\tWith the inception of the HTSUSA, heading 6115, HTSUSA, provided for stockings for varicose veins while heading 9021, HTSUSA, provided for orthopedic appliances.  In 1991, Customs distinguished between orthopedic appliances and stockings for varicose veins.  Customs held that stockings which supplied a compression range of 30-40 mm Hg, 40-50 mm Hg, or 50-60 mm Hg were classifiable as orthopedic appliances of heading 9021, HTSUSA.  See Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 088272, dated March 1, 1992, and HQ 086146, dated March 14, 1991.  The articles were available by prescription only through medical and surgical supply outlets and a patient had to be measured and fitted by trained personnel to ensure a proper fit.  In describing the stockings as more than simply compression stockings for the treatment of varicose veins, Customs relied on the fact that they were prescribed by a physician for the treatment of serious venous diseases and other serious conditions such as reversible and irreversible lymphedema and severe post-thrombotic treatment.  While acknowledging the articles could be used for patients with varicose veins, Customs found that they were also used in large numbers for patients with post-operative swelling, including orthopedic patients.  Customs concluded that the articles acted to prevent the consequences of venous disease in that they prevented significant swelling and could be determined to prevent deformity in regard to venous ulcerations and dermatitis. \r\r\tIn 1992, the HTSUSA was amended to transfer surgical stockings and panty hose with graduated compression out of heading 9021, HTSUSA, to heading 6115, HTSUSA.  Special subheadings were created to specifically provide for surgical compression panty hose and stockings for orthopedic purposes.  For a detailed history of the transfer from heading 9021, HTSUSA, to heading 6115, HTSUSA, see HQ 959399, dated December 16, 1996.  Since that time, Customs has consistently limited the classification of surgical compression panty hose and stockings to items which have a minimum compression of 30 mm Hg.  HQ 959399, dated December 16, 1996; NY B87014, dated August 6, 1997; NY B81996, dated February 24, 1997; NY E82160, dated June 10, 1999; NY E82592; dated June 11, 1999; NY E82593, dated June 11, 1999; NY E82594, dated June 11, 1999; NY E82595, dated June 11, 1999; NY E82596, dated June 11, 1999; and NY F80388, dated December 28, 1999.  These rulings also indicate that Customs has generally  required that the articles be prescribed by a physician.  \r\r\tProtestant contends that earlier changes in the language of the surgical stockings provision broadened the subheading to include stockings merely for the treatment of varicose veins.   Specifically, Protestant argues that the deletion of the phase “other than stockings merely for the treatment of varicose veins” brought stockings merely for the treatment of varicose veins within the ambit of the surgical stockings provision.  We disagree.  Customs has previously addressed this argument and explained that tariff classification history and International Trade Commission practice justify separate classification.  HQ 959399, dated December 16, 1996.\r\r\tProtestant next contends that numerous medical studies support the effectiveness of stockings with compression under 30 mm Hg.  Although Protestant was unable to supply copies of the cited studies, this office is aware  of a study which evaluates the effects of duration of use of class I (20-30 mm Hg) graduated compression hosiery.  See Robert Weiss, Neil Sadick, Mitchel Goldman, & Margaret Weiss, Post-Sclerotherapy Compression: Controlled Comparative Study of Duration of Compression and its Effects on Clinical Outcome  Dermatol Surg, 35: 105-108 (1999).  Most importantly, the study persuades this office that compression greater than 20 mm Hg is presently considered necessary for reduction of venous insufficiency.  The study makes certain important statements including “. . . in terms of controlling objective and subjective parameters of venous insufficiency no difference was found between class I (20-30 mm Hg) and class II (30-40 mm Hg) compression stockings.”  The study also suggests that sclerotherapy results overall can be significantly improved by class I compression and should be part of the post-operative sclerotherapy protocol.  In citing other studies, the study concludes that class I (20-30 mm Hg) compression may be recommended over class II since patient compliance is much higher and symptom improvement is identical.  See Jungbeck C, Thulin I, Darenheim C, Norgen L.  Graduated Compression Treatment in Patients with Chronic Venous Insufficiency; A Study Comparing Low and Medium Grade Compression Stockings.  Phlebologie, 12:142-5 (1997). \r\rThis office also reviewed several letters from vascular surgeons and dermatologists familiar with the beneficial effects of compression on the venous.  The letters indicated agreement within the medical community that surgical stockings with graduated compression of 20-30 mm Hg are principally used for orthopedic purposes and are primarily prescribed by physicians to prevent or correct bodily deformities and the consequences associated with venous disease.  The letters also establish that it is widely recognized that 20 mm Hg of compression is considered necessary for the treatment of venous disease.  The physicians state that they recommend using surgical supports with graduated compression of 20 to 30 mm Hg to prevent telangiectatic matting following sclerotherapy, to prevent thrombus formation and phlebitic reactions following sclerotherapy, to reduce post-operative edema, to prevent venous ulcerations, to prevent venous dermatitis and as treatment protocol for post-operative invasive vascular procedures.  \r\rThe letters from the medical authorities and conversations with medical professionals confirm that a patient must be measured by certified and well-trained personnel in order to obtain a proper fit for the stockings.  The doctors indicate that patients generally find the hosiery uncomfortable and do not <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them unless directed by a physician.  Lastly, the letters advise that surgical stockings are significantly more expensive than support hosiery of the types generally found in retail stores.  \r\rResearch by this office indicates that physicians recommend graduated compression therapy as a treatment for venous insufficiency.\u0002  Graduated compression hosiery is generally available in three classes of compression; class I specifically covers a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg.  Compression stockings are generally prescribed by a physician.  The pharmacy or medical supply staff will take measurements of various parts of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and leg in order to fit the stocking and prefer that a patient have a prescription which prescribes the amount of compression.  Stockings obtained by prescription are often covered by insurance.  Graduated compression stockings are significantly more expensive than support hosiery of the types generally found in retail stores.   Panty hose with 20-30 mm Hg compression typically sell for approximately $75.00 to $100.00.  Similar thigh-high stockings typically sell for $60.00 to $95.00 per pair.\r\rCustoms finds that surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg should be considered surgical panty hosiery with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment when they are primarily prescribed by a physician and are specially fitted to the patient by certified well-trained personnel.  \r\rThe following information was obtained from MediUSA’s website:\rMediven compression stockings are designed to help push stretched or damaged veins back into place, helping the valves close properly so your veins can carry blood throughout your body with near normal efficiency.  “Graduated compression” means the compression is stronger at the bottom of the leg-at the ankles and calves - and steadily decreases in pressure toward the top of the leg.  This feature helps counteract the effects of gravity and reduces swelling in the feet and ankles.\r\rMedical compression stockings must be prescribed by a physician and individually fitted for maximum effectiveness and comfort.  Once your doctor prescribes the compression strength and type, they can recommend an authorized fitter to measure and fit you with the right size.  The correct fit and appropriate compression strength is very important to ensure that you have the best chance possible to fight vein disease.\r\rhttp://www.mediusa.com/compTherapy.html\r\rCompression stockings should only be worn after consulting with your doctor and with your physician’s prescription.\r\rYour authorized Mediven retailer is trained as a professional fitter.  You  must have your measurements taken by a fitter before purchasing Mediven prescription stockings.  Your precise measurements will be taken at a fitting including your waist, hips, thighs, calves, ankles and feet.  Fittings usually take place at a medical supply store.\r\rhttp://www.mediusa.com/right.html\r\rCustoms believes the instant graduated compression hosiery is within the scope of the subheadings providing for surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\r\rTo the extent that this ruling conflicts with previous rulings on surgical stockings supplying compression in the range of 20-30 mm Hg, please be advised that those rulings are under review to determine whether they should be the subject of a proposed notice of modification.\r\rAnti-Embolism Stockings\r\rThe anti-embolism stockings only provide 18 mm Hg of compression.  This falls below the minimum 20-30 mm Hg standard established above.  Protestant argues that non-ambulatory patients needs are met by a lesser degree of compression.  However, no evidence has been presented to persuade this office that 18 mm Hg of compression should be considered the minimum amount of compression necessary for treating venous disease for non-ambulatory patients.  Furthermore, the anti-embolism stockings are distinguishable from the stockings discussed previously in that they are available without prescription and do not require specialized fitting.  Additionally, the terms of the subheading clearly require the stockings to provide graduated compression.  The instant stocking supply equalized compression, not graduated compression.  \r\rProtestant’s own website indicates that the instant stockings are distinctly different from surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  Hospital stockings, such as the anti-embolism stockings, which offer mild equalized compression for bedridden patients are commonly used on patients recuperating after various surgeries.  The stockings are worn by non-ambulatory patients to prevent blood clots during the healing process.  They are specifically designed for patients who are lying down in bed.  While lying down, blood pressure is equalized along the leg.  These hospital stockings are not made to treat vein disease for patients who are on their feet.  Only medically prescribed graduated compression stockings provide the correct type of therapy for the daily treatment of vein disease.   The hospital stockings are ineffective for the treatment of vein disease because they cannot support the vein walls for upright patients and merely prevent blood clots for bedridden patients.  Customs finds this class of merchandise to be distinguishable from surgical stocking with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  Accordingly, the anti-embolism stockings are beyond the scope of the subheading providing for surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment and are classifiable as other stockings.\r\rHOLDING:\r\rBased on the foregoing, the graduated compression panty hose are classifiable under subheading 6115.12.1000, HTSUSA, which is the provision for surgical panty hose with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  The applicable rate of duty was1.2 percent ad valorem in1998 and “Free” in 1999.\r\r\r\r\rThe graduated compression stockings are classifiable under subheading 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA, which is the provision for surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  The applicable rate of duty was 2.3 percent ad valorem in 1998 and “Free” in 1999.  \r\rThe anti-embolism stockings are classifiable under subheading 6115.93.9020, HTSUSA, which is the provision for other stockings not containing lace or net. \u0002  The applicable rate of duty was 15.1 percent ad valorem in 1998 and 15 percent ad valorem in 1999.  The textile category code is 632.\r\rThe protest should be ALLOWED in part and DENIED in part.  In accordance with Section 3A(11)(b) of Customs Directive 099 3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject: Revised Protest Directive, you are to mail this decision, together with the Customs Form 19, to the protestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter.  Any reliquidation of the entry or entries in accordance with the decision must be accomplished prior to mailing the decision.\r\rSixty days from the date of the decision, the Office of Regulations and Rulings will make the decision available to Customs personnel, and to the public on the Customs Home Page on the World Wide Web at www.customs.gov, by means of the Freedom of Information Act, and other methods of public distribution.\r\r\r Sincerely,\r\r\r\rJohn Durant, Director\rCommercial Rulings Division\r\r\r"",""url"":""/docs/hq/2002/963517.doc"",""id"":18682,""rulingNumber"":""963517"",""subject"":""Decision on Application for Further Review of Protest 1704-99-100314; Classification of Graduated Compression Panty Hose and Stockings; Classification of Anti-Embolism Stockings"",""categories"":""Classification"",""rulingDate"":""2002-01-02T02:00:00"",""isUsmca"":false,""isNafta"":false,""collection"":""hq"",""relatedRulings"":[""088272"",""086146"",""959399"",""B87014"",""B81996"",""E82160"",""E82592"",""E82593"",""E82594"",""E82595"",""E82596"",""F80388""],""modifiedBy"":[],""modifies"":[],""revokedBy"":[],""revokes"":[],""tariffs"":[""6115.12.1000"",""6115.93.3000"",""6115.93.9020""]}"

John Sims Parkway, Suite 3\rNiceville, FL 32578\r\rRE:  \tModification of New York Ruling Letter E82592, dated June 10, 1999; Classification of Medical Graduated Compression Hosiery\r\rDear Mr. Miesen:\r\rThis letter concerns New York Ruling Letter (NY) E82592, issued to you on June 11, 1999, regarding the tariff classification of compression hosiery under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA).  After review of that ruling, Customs has determined that the classification for one of the two styles considered has changed from subheading 6115.92.9000, as stockings to subheading 6115.92.3000, HTSUSA, as surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  For the reasons that follow, this ruling modifies, in part, NY E82592.\r\rPursuant to section 625(c)(1) Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1625(c)(1)) as amended by section 623 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-82, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186), notice of the proposed modification of NY E82592 was published on January 8, 2003, in the Customs Bulletin, Volume 37, Number 2.  As explained in the notice, the period within which to submit comments on this proposal was until February 7, 2003.  No comments were received in response to this notice.\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe article under consideration is one style of compression hosiery, identified in NY E82592 as Style Cotton 162 (style 162). Style 162 is comprised of 66 percent cotton, 17 percent polyamide and 17 percent elastane fabric, with a decitex of 486.  Style 162 supplies graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg1 and is prescribed by a physician.  \r\rIn NY E82592, Customs classified style 162 in subheading 6115.92.9000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Other: Of cotton: Other: Other.\"" We note that at the time NY E82592 was issued we considered the following: \r \rIt is Customs position that surgical compression hosiery, because of their construction and application of use, are more than simple compression stockings to treat varicose veins.  The hosiery is made of heavy gauge, opaque, elasticized knit fabric, and is designed to supply compression in the range of 30-40 mm mercury to 50-60 mercury.  They are prescribed by physicians for the treatment of venous diseases and other serious conditions such as reversible and irreversible lymphedema and severe post-thrombotic treatment.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper classification of the subject graduated compression hosiery under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.

PHLEBOLOGIE, 12:142-5 (1997). \r\rMoreover, during our review of HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, this office examined several letters from vascular surgeons and dermatologists familiar with the beneficial effects of compression on the venous system.  The letters indicated consensus within the medical community that surgical stockings with graduated compression of 20-30 mm Hg are principally used for orthopedic purposes and are primarily prescribed by physicians to prevent or correct bodily deformities and the consequences associated with venous disease.  The letters established that it is widely recognized that 20 mm Hg of compression is considered necessary for the treatment of venous disease.  We noted in HQ 963517 and HQ 963518 that the physicians stated that they recommend using surgical supports with graduated compression of 20 to 30 mm Hg for several reasons: to prevent telangiectatic matting following sclerotherapy, to prevent thrombus formation and phlebitic reactions following sclerotherapy, to reduce post-operative edema, to prevent venous ulcerations, to prevent venous dermatitis and as treatment protocol for post-operative invasive vascular procedures.  \r\rIn HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, Customs determined that physicians generally recommend graduated compression therapy as a treatment for venous insufficiency.  We further recognized that graduated compression hosiery is generally available in three classes of compression; class I specifically covers a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg.  We found that physicians generally prescribe compression stockings and that doctors indicated that patients generally find the hosiery uncomfortable and do not <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them unless directed by a doctor.  Moreover, letters from medical authorities and conversations with medical professionals confirmed that certified and well-trained personnel must measure various parts of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and leg of a patient in order to obtain a proper fit for the stockings.  We also found that pharmacies and medical supply companies prefer that a patient have a prescription that prescribes the amount of compression and noted that stockings obtained by prescription are often covered by insurance.  We observed that graduated compression stockings are significantly more expensive than support hosiery of the types generally found in retail stores, noting that panty hose with 20-30 mm Hg compression typically sell for approximately $75.00 to $100.00 and similar thigh-high stockings typically sell for $60.00 to $95.00 per pair.\r\rAccordingly, in HQ 963517 and HQ 963518, we concluded that surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg should be considered surgical hosiery with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment when prescribed by a physician and/or specially fitted to the patient.  \r\rAs the subject merchandise has a graduated compression range of 20-30 mm Hg and is prescribed by a physician, Customs finds the instant graduated compression hosiery is within the scope of subheading 6115.92.3000, HTSUSA, providing for surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\r\rHOLDING:\r\rBased on the foregoing, style 162 is classified under subheading 6115.92.3000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Other: Of cotton: Surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\"" The general column one rate of duty is \""Free.\"" \r\rNY E82592 is hereby MODIFIED, in part.

John Sims Parkway, Suite 3\rNiceville, FL 32578\r\rRE:  \tModification of New York Ruling Letter E82160, dated June 10, 1999; Classification of Medical Graduated Compression Panty Hose\r\rDear Mr. Miesen:\r\rThis letter concerns New York Ruling Letter (NY) E82160, issued to you on June 10, 1999, regarding the tariff classification of medical compression panty hose under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA).  After review of that ruling, Customs has determined that the classification for two out of the three styles considered has changed from subheading 6115.12.2000, HTSUSA, as other panty hose to subheading 6115.12.1000, HTSUSA, as surgical panty hose with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  For the reasons that follow, this ruling modifies, in part, NY E82160.\r\rPursuant to section 625(c)(1) Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1625(c)(1)) as amended by section 623 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-82, 107 Stat. 2057, 2186), notice of the proposed modification of NY E82160 was published on January 8, 2003, in the Customs Bulletin, Volume 37, Number 2.  As explained in the notice, the period within which to submit comments on this proposal was until February 7, 2003.  No comments were received in response to this notice.\r\r\r\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe articles under consideration are two styles of compression panty hose, identified in NY E82160 as Style Lady Gloria 24 and Style Soft 151. Style Lady Gloria 24 is comprised of 76 percent polyamide and 24 percent elastane fabric, with a decitex of 226 and supplies graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg.1 Style Soft 151 is comprised of 68 percent polyamide and 32 percent elastane fabric, with a decitex of 486 and supplies compression in the range of 20-30 mm Hg.  \r\rIn NY E82160, we classified Style Lady Gloria 24 and Style Soft 151 in subheading 6115.12.2000, HTSUSA, which provides for \""Panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted: Panty hose and tights: Of synthetic fibers, measuring per single yarn 67 decitex or more: Other.\"" We note that at the time NY E82160 was issued we considered the following:  \r\rIt is Customs position that surgical compression hosiery, because of their construction and application of use, are more than simple compression stockings to treat varicose veins.  The hosiery is made of heavy gauge, opaque, elasticized knit fabric, and is designed to supply compression in the range of 30-40 mm mercury to 50-60 mercury.  They are prescribed by physicians for the treatment of venous diseases and other serious conditions such as reversible and irreversible lymphedema and severe post-thrombotic treatment.\r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper classification of the subject graduated compression panty hose under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.

In your submission, you request a ruling concerning whether certain reusable cylinders qualify as instruments of international traffic (“IITs”) and are therefore classifiable under subheading 9803.00.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”).  Our decision follows.\r\rFACTS\r\r\tThe following facts are from your July 27, 2021, ruling request, as well as your response to a request for additional information dated December 6, 2021. The subject items are reusable cylinders made of Steel SAE 10008 with an anticipated life expectancy of 20 or more years. The cylinders are manufactured in the United States, as are approximately 80% of the valves attached to the cylinders. The remaining valves, MegaTOPs, are from Europe and constitute the valves on approximately 20% of cylinders moving between the U.S. and Canada.\r\tMesser owns the vast majority of the approximately 65,000 cylinders which are filled with various gases in the United States, exported to Canada, and are returned in a “near-empty” condition to the United States, typically within a 365-day period. The remaining 1-5% of the cylinders are owned by various customers.\r\tMesser empties and ships the cylinders primarily from branches in Canada which include Brampton; Montreal; Langley; and Whitby. U.S. ports of entry for the cylinders include Ogdensburg, New York; Alexandria Bay, New York; Buffalo, New York; Blaine, Washington; Area Port of Sweetgrass, Montana; Pembina (Area Port), North Dakota; Portal, North Dakota; Port Huron, Michigan. \r\tThe cylinders are barcoded and tracked by Messer for inventory and scrapped container barcodes are recorded monthly. The most frequent repair needed on the containers are valve changes, which are done in both the United States and Canada to ensure safe transport of the compressed gases inside the cylinders. Messer is able to share their records of scrapped containers with CBP.\r\tThe following are images of the cylinders, taken from your December 6, 2021, response to our request for additional information:\rCylinders\r\u0001\r\u0001\r\u0001\r\rValves\r\u0001\r\u0001\rBarcodes\r\u0001\r\u0001\r\rISSUES\rWhether these cylinders may be considered IIT?\rIf these cylinders may be considered IIT, would the cylinders be classified under HTS 9803.00.50?\r\rWould a separate IIT bond be required?\rWhether tracking the cylinders by individual barcode or a First In First Out method would be an acceptable inventory method?\r\rDo valve change repairs increase the value of the affected cylinders?\rIf valve change repairs occur outside the US, does it disqualify the cylinder as IIT?\rLAW AND ANALYSIS\rIssue 1\rPer 19 C.F.R. § 141.4(a), “all merchandise imported into the United States is required to be entered, unless specifically excepted.”  The four exceptions to the requirement of entry are listed under 19 C.F.R. § 141.4(b), one of which is instruments of international traffic (“IITs”).  19 C.F.R. § 141.4(b)(3). Subheading 9803.00.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”) provides for the duty-free treatment of:\r\rSubstantial containers and holders, if products of the United States (including shooks and staves of United States production when returned as boxes or barrels containing merchandise), or if of foreign production and previously imported and duty (if any) thereon paid, or if of a class specified by the Secretary of the Treasury\u0002 as instruments of international traffic, repair components for containers of foreign production which are instruments of international traffic, and accessories and equipment for such containers, whether the accessories and equipment are imported with a container to be reexported separately or with another container, or imported separately to be reexported with a container.  \r\r(footnote and emphasis added). \r\rSubchapter 98 of the HTSUS only applies to:\r\r(a) Substantial containers or holders which are subject to tariff treatment as imported articles and are:\r(i) Imported empty and not within the purview of a provision which specifically exempts them from duty; or\r(ii) Imported containing or holding articles, and which are not of a kind normally sold therewith or are entered separately therefrom; and \t\r(b) Certain repair components, accessories and equipment.\r\rSee U.S. Note 1, et seq., Chapter 98, HTSUS.\r\rPursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1322(a), IITs shall be excepted from the application of the Customs laws to the extent that such terms and conditions are prescribed in regulations or instructions. The relevant CBP regulations implementing that statute are found at 19 C.F.R. § 10.41a(a)(1) which provides in pertinent part:\r\rLift vans, cargo vans, shipping tanks, skids, pallets, caul boards, and cores for textile fabrics, arriving (whether loaded or empty) in use or to be used in the shipment of merchandise in international traffic are hereby designated as “instruments of international traffic” [. . .] The Commissioner of Customs [now CBP] is authorized to designate as instruments of international traffic […] such additional articles or classes of articles as he shall find should be so designated. \r\r19 C.F.R. § 10.41a(a)(1) (emphasis added).\r\rSuch instruments may be released without entry or the payment of duty, subject to the provisions of this section.\r\rTo qualify for entry-free and duty-free treatment as IITs under the aforementioned statutory and regulatory authority, the article must be a substantial container or holder.  As stated above, CBP is authorized to designate as an IIT such additional articles not specifically noted in 19 C.F.R. § 10.41a(a)(1). To qualify as an IIT within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. § 1322(a) and 19 C.F.R. § 10.41a(a)(1), an article used as a container or holder must be: (1) substantial, (2) suitable for and capable of repeated use, and (3) used in significant numbers in international traffic.  See HQ H291037 (Jan. 9, 2018); HQ H016491 (Oct. 1, 2007); HQ 114150 (Dec. 12, 1997); HQ 107545 (May 7, 1985); Treas. Dec. 71-159, Cust. B. & Dec. 296 (June 18, 1971); 99 Treas. Dec. 533, No. 56247 (Aug. 26, 1964).\u0002\r\rThe subject cylinders are substantial as they are made of steel and have a life expectancy of 20 or more years. These cylinders are also suitable for and capable of repeated use in that they are typically reused annually throughout their life expectancy. There are also a significant number of cylinders in international traffic, with approximately 65,000 cylinders moved between the United States and Canada per year. \r\rIn the present case, the subject cylinders hold merchandise independent of the shipping containers in which they are transported because they are filled with gases to be transported to Canada. As a result, we find that the Messer cylinders are substantial holders or containers and may accordingly be classified as IITs.\r\rIssue 2\r\tInasmuch as the Messer cylinders qualify as IITs and are substantial containers or holders, Messer may classify the cylinders under HTS 9803.00.50. \rIssue 3\r\tAs outlined above, 19 C.F.R. § 10.41a(a)(1) provides that certain items used in the “shipment of merchandise in international traffic” are IITs. 19 C.F.R. § 10.41a(c) requires that IITs designated under 19 C.F.R. § 10.41a(a) require a bond to be filed on Customs Form 301 containing the bond conditions outlined in 19 C.F.R. § 113.66 prior to their release.\r\t19 C.F.R. § 10.41b(a) provides that “holders and containers in this section may be released without entry or the payment of duty, subject to the provisions of this section.” 19 C.F.R. § 10.41b(b) provides, in part:\rSubject to the approval of a\u00A0port director\u00A0pursuant to the procedures described in this paragraph, certain\u00A0foreign- or U.S.-made shipping devices arriving from Canada or Mexico, including racks, holders, pallets, totes, boxes and cans, need not be serially numbered or marked if they are always transported on or within either intermodal and similar containers or containers which are themselves vehicles or vehicle appurtenances and accessories such as twenty and forty <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> containers of general use and “igloo” air freight containers. \r\t19 C.F.R. § 113.66 outlines IIT bond conditions. As the cylinders may be categorized as IIT, they may be released without entry or the payment of duty, but still must file a Customs bond. Therefore, the cylinders would require that an IIT bond is filed.\rIssue 4\r\tIn your December 6, 2021, response to our request for additional information, you state that the cylinders are barcoded and tracked by Messer for inventory. Additionally, the barcodes of scrapped container are recorded monthly in records that Messer is able to share with CBP. Therefore, as Messer has demonstrated the capacity to do so, Messer should track the cylinders by individual barcode and report the location of each cylinder, as well as the barcode numbers of any scrapped containers to CBP on a monthly basis.\r\r\rIssue 5 \r\tCentral to the question of whether valve change repairs increase the value of the affected cylinders is the definition of the word “repair.” In United States v. Admiral Oriental Line et al., 18 C.C.P.A. 137, 141 (Oct. 15, 1930), the Court cited definitions of “repair” in Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary, the first of which defined “repair” as:\r\t“The process of repairing; restoration after decay, waste, injury, or partial destruction; supply of loss; reparation; as, the repair of a building; often in the plural; as, to make repairs on a roof.”\r\tThe Court quoted Gagnon v. United States, 193 U.S. 451, 457 (Mar. 21, 1904), where the United States Supreme Court stated:\r\r\t“The word ‘repair,’ as the word ‘amend,’ contemplates an existing structure which has become imperfect by reason of the action of the elements, or otherwise.”\r \r\tSection 904(b) of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114-125, February 24, 2016) amended subheading 9801.00.10, HTSUS, to include any products which are returned within 3 years after having been exported.  Previously, subheading 9801.00.10, HTSUS, only applied to products of the United States. Subheading 9801.00.10, HTSUS, now provides for the duty-free treatment of:\r\t“Products of the United States when returned after having been exported, or any other products when returned within 3 years after having been exported, without having been advanced in value or improved in condition by any process of manufacture or other means while abroad.” \r\tIn HQ H555754 (Feb. 4, 1991), Customs found that U.S.-origin spools restored in Mexico were entitled to duty-free treatment because they were merely restored to their exported condition. Consequently, the spools were not advanced in value or improved in condition. Similarly, valve change repairs to cylinders, whether done in the U.S. or abroad, which merely restore cylinders to the condition they were in when exported would not advance the value of the cylinders.\r\tThe subject gas cylinders and their contemplated valve replacements would be items which have been made imperfect through <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and tear. Replacing the valves with new valves which only serve to restore the cylinders to their original condition after “decay, waste, injury, or partial destruction,” would not increase the value of the cylinders. Therefore, valve change repairs to the subject cylinders which do not improve the cylinders in condition, but only serve to restore the cylinders to their original condition after “decay, waste, injury, or partial destruction” would not increase the value of the repaired cylinders.\rIssue 6 \r\tIn HQ 278564 (Sept. 8, 2016), Customs ruled that U.S.-origin products exported in a new condition and then processed abroad to keep the product in operable and serviceable conditions are still entitled to duty-free treatment upon their return to the U.S. Similarly, in addressing whether valve change repairs occurring outside the US would disqualify the cylinders as IITs, if the repairs merely serve to restore the cylinders to their pre-export condition “after decay, waste, injury, or partial destruction,” the contemplated valve repairs would not disqualify the cylinders as IITs. Rather, the valve repairs would serve to preserve the cylinders’ function as IITs, as the cylinders would not be able to serve as IITs without functioning valves. Such a valve repair made while the cylinder is abroad would not improve the cylinder’s condition by “any process of manufacture or other means.” Therefore, valve change repairs of the subject cylinders occurring outside the U.S. would not disqualify the cylinders from consideration as IITs.\rHOLDING\r\rThe subject reusable cylinders are IITs within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. § 1322(a) and 19 C.F.R. § 10.41a(a)(1). An IIT bond must be filed for the cylinders. Messer should track the cylinders by individual barcode and report the location of each cylinder, as well as the barcode numbers of any scrapped containers to CBP on a monthly basis. Valve change repairs to the subject cylinders which do not improve the cylinders in condition, but only serve to restore the cylinders to their original condition after “decay, waste, injury, or partial destruction” would not increase the value of the repaired cylinders. Valve change repairs of the subject cylinders occurring outside the U.S. done to restore the cylinders’ pre-export condition would not disqualify the cylinders from consideration as IITs. \r\rSincerely,\r\r\r\r\rW.

Woolworth Co., concerning\rthe classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the\rUnited States (HTSUS), of an article identified as a \""5 <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">Foot</span>\rJointed Glow Skeleton,\"" to be imported from China.  A sample was\rsubmitted with your inquiry.  \r\rFACTS:\r\r     The sample article, identified by item no. 9847, is a two-\rdimensional, essentially flat skeleton that measures\rapproximately five feet in height.  It is comprised of sturdy\rplastic that glows in the dark, and contains metal, grommet-type\rhinges at the neck, shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee joints.  The\ritem is described as \""An indoor/outdoor decoration to treat those\rtricksters!  Already assembled and reusable, too!  Fly 'em high\rfrom a roof, tree, porch or door... Or hang indoors on a wall,\rfrom a ceiling or a doorway!\""\r\rISSUE:\r\r     Whether the article is classified in heading 9505, HTSUS, as\ra festive article, or in heading 3926, HTSUS, as an other article\rof plastics.                   -2-\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\r     Classification under the HTSUS is made in accordance with\rthe General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs).  The systematic\rdetail of the harmonized system is such that virtually all goods\rare classified by application of GRI 1, that is, according to the\rterms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative\rSection or Chapter Notes.  In the event that the goods cannot be\rclassified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and\rlegal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs may then\rbe applied.  The Explanatory Notes (ENs) to the Harmonized\rCommodity Description and Coding System, which represent the\rofficial interpretation of the tariff at the international level,\rfacilitate classification under the HTSUS by offering guidance in\runderstanding the scope of the headings and GRIs.\r\r     Heading 9505, HTSUS, provides for, among other items,\rfestive, carnival or other entertainment articles.  The EN to\rheading 9505 states, in part, that the heading covers:\r\r     (A) Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles, which\r     in view of their intended use are generally made of non-\r     durable material.  They include:\r\r          (1) Decorations such as festoons, garlands, Chinese\r          lanterns, etc., as well as various decorative articles\r          made of paper, metal foil, glass fibre, etc., for\r          Christmas trees (e.g., tinsel, stars, icicles),\r          artificial snow, coloured balls, bells, lanterns, etc. \r          Cake and other decorations (e.g., animals, flags) which\r          are traditionally associated with a particular festival\r          are also classified here.\r\r     In general, merchandise is classifiable in heading 9505,\rHTSUS, as a festive article when the article, as a whole:\r\r     1.   is of non-durable material or, generally, is not\r          purchased because of its extreme worth, or intrinsic\r          value (e.g., paper, cardboard, metal foil, glass fiber,\r          plastic, wood);\r\r     2.   functions primarily as a decoration (e.g., its primary\r          function is not utilitarian); and\r\r     3.   is traditionally associated or used with a particular\r          festival (e.g., stockings and tree ornaments for\r          Christmas, decorative eggs for Easter).  -3-\r\r     An article's satisfaction of these three criteria is\rindicative of classification as a festive article.  The motif of\ran item is not dispositive of its classification and,\rconsequently, does not transform an item into a festive article.\r\r     We consider the subject article to be made of non-durable\rmaterial.  Although it is plastic and reusable, it is not\rdesigned for sustained <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> and tear, nor is it purchased because\rof its extreme worth or value.  The item is also primarily\rdecorative in function.\r\r     Upon examination of the third criterion, however, we find\rthat skeletons are not traditionally associated or used with a\rparticular festival.  They are not the same types of articles\rcited in the ENs to 9505, as examples of traditional, festive\rarticles.  Although a glowing skeleton may suggest a Halloween\rtheme, an item's motif - as noted above - does not transform an\rarticle not traditionally associated with Halloween into a\rfestive article.  In classifying traditional festive articles for\rHalloween, it is Customs position that only jack-o'-lanterns of a\rpumpkin shape or form that are capable of illumination qualify as\rfestive articles.  See Headquarters Ruling Letter 951897, issued\rAugust 26, 1992.  Thus, the item is not classified as a festive\rarticle under heading 9505, HTSUS, and must be classified\relsewhere.\r\r     Heading 3926, HTSUS, provides for \""Other articles of\rplastics and articles of other materials of headings 3901 to\r3914.\""  The EN to heading 3926 indicates that the heading covers\rarticles of plastics or other materials not elsewhere specified\ror included, including (among other items) statuettes and other\rornamental articles.  At the six-digit subheading level, 3926.40,\rHTSUS, includes other articles of plastics, statuettes and other\rornamental articles.

Pollack, Esq. on behalf of Carrini, Inc. against your decision regarding the proper classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA) for women’s sandals.  The entries at issue were liquidated on November 8, and 15, 1996.\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe merchandise at issue, identified as style 7606, is a woman's high heeled shoe with an exterior surface comprised of five (5) sets of rubber/plastic straps.  These straps begin at the toes and run to the ankle.  Each strap is folded to create a loop.  The ends of the loop are then sewn into the sole of the shoe, thereby forming a type of eyelet.  The ten (10) eyelets, five (5) per side, are then brought together by means of a textile lace.  The lace is threaded through the eyelets to pull the loop/strap closed around the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The laces complete the upper by holding the loops around the wearer’s leg.  While worn the laces will be visible.\r\rThe entries covering styles 7606 were liquidated on November 8 and 15, 1996, under subheading 6402.99.30, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSUSA), with duty at the rate of 37.5% ad valorem.  The protest was timely filed on February 6, 1997.\r\r\fProtestant claims that the laces were improperly included in determining the external surface area of the shoe’s upper, and that the shoe is properly classifiable under subheading 6402.99.18, HTSUSA, with duty at the rate of 18.6% ad valorem.  \r\r2\r\rThe surface area of the lace was included in the Customs laboratory calculation that textile material covered 12.4 % of the external surface of the upper (ESAU).  If the lace had not been included in this calculation, the upper would have been reported as being entirely composed of rubber or plastics, thereby, causing the shoe to be classified as footwear of which over 90% of the surface area of the upper is rubber or plastic as claimed by the protestant.   \r\rISSUE: \r\rWhat is included in measuring the external surface area of the upper?  \r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS: \r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI's).  GRI 1 provides that \""classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes, and, provided such heading or notes do not otherwise require, according to [the remaining GRI's].\""  In other words, classification is governed first by the terms of the headings of the tariff and any relative section or chapter notes.\r\rThe competing provisions are as follows: \r\r6402      Other footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or\rplastics:\r*\t*\t*\r6402.99  \r\rOther:\r\rHaving uppers of which over 90 percent of the external surface area\r(including any accessories or reinforcements such as those\rmentioned in note 4(a) to this chapter) is rubber or plastics\r(except footwear having a foxing or a foxing\u001Elike band applied or\rmolded at the sole and overlapping the upper and except footwear\rdesigned to be worn over, or in lieu of, other footwear as a\rprotection against water, oil, grease or chemicals or cold or\rinclement weather): \r*\t*\t*\r6402.99.18 Other:\r*\t*\t*\r6402.99.30\rFootwear with open toes or open heels; footwear of the\r\fslip\u001Eon type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of\rlaces or buckles or other fasteners, the foregoing\r\r3\r\rexcept footwear of subheading 6402.99.20 and except footwear\rhaving a  foxing or a foxing\u001Elike band wholly or almost\rwholly of rubber or plastics applied or molded at the sole\rand overlapping the upper...  \r\rNote 3 to chapter 64, HTSUSA, reads, as follows:\r\r3.   \tFor the purposes of this chapter:\r\r(a) the terms “rubber” and “plastics\"" include woven fabrics or other textile \t\t     \t     products with an external layer of rubber or plastics being visible to the\r     naked eye;...\r\rThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN) to the HTSUSA, although not dispositive should be looked to for the proper interpretation of the HTSUSA.  See T.D. 89\u001E80, 54 FR 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). In part, General EN (D) to chapter 64, HTSUSA, provides that “(f)or the purposes of the classification of footwear in this Chapter, the constituent material of the uppers must also be taken into account... .”  With respect to uppers which consists of two or more materials, note 4(a) to chapter 64 states that: \r\r4.   Subject to note 3 to this chapter: \r\r(a)  The material of the upper shall be taken to be the\rconstituent material having the greatest external\rsurface area, no account being taken of\raccessories or reinforcements such as ankle\rpatches, edging, ornamentation, buckles, tabs,\reyelet stays or similar attachments[.]\r\rIn T.D. 93\u001E88, dated October 25, 1993, “external surface area of the upper” is defined, in pertinent part, as:\r\rThe “external surface” of the upper is, in general, the outside surface of what you \tsee covering the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> (and leg, if applicable) when the shoe is worn.\r\r    A.  It does not include:\r\r\f1.  Accessories and reinforcements such as ankle patches, edging, ornamentation,  \t\t     (i.e., tassels, pompoms, or braids), buckles, tabs, eyelet stays, slide fasteners, or \t\t     similar attachments.  Other examples include the leather pieces sewn on top of  \t\t     the lower part of the upper in basketball shoes, and “filled\u001Ein” embroidery.\r  \t\t\t\r*\t** \t*\r\r4\r\r5.  Shoe laces which do not cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by themselves and VELCRO straps \t\t     which are a substitute for shoe laces.\r\rIn determining the proper classification for the subject merchandise there are two requisite steps which must be followed.  First, a review of T.D. 93\u001E88 reveals that ornamentation, among other things, is not included in the determination of the external surface area of the upper.  However, having an understanding of how the “external surface area of the upper” is defined does not by itself bring us to the appropriate provision in the tariff for this merchandise.  Thus, the second step involves compliance with the appropriate subheading provisions for the merchandise.  \r\rProtestant claims that Customs classification is incorrect under the GRI’s.   It is their position that the sandals at issue here do not meet the criteria for classification under subheading 6402.99.30, HTSUSA, because of the presence of the laces.  It is protestant’s understanding that the headnote only applies to \""footwear with open toes or open heels\"" “...that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or fasteners . . .\""  The heading has been interpreted by protestant as excluding shoes which are held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by use of laces.  Protestant states that it would be impossible to <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> the submitted shoe absent the use of laces, as the shoe would remain open around the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and would fall off with the slightest movement.  Therefore, it is maintained that classification for the sandals is under subheading 6402.99.30, HTSUSA, is incorrect.  The appropriate provision for these sandals is claimed to be subheading 6402.99.1865, HTSUSA.\r\rWe disagree.  The provision for \""footwear with open toes or open heels\"" is separated from the provision for \""footwear of the slip\u001Eon type, that is held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or fasteners . . .\"" by a semicolon.  We interpret this construction to mean that open toe or heel shoes are to be considered separately for the purposes of classification under subheading 6402.99.30, HTSUSA.  Consequently, since the sandals in issue qualify for classification as open toe or open heel footwear, they need not meet the requirement for slip\u001Eon footwear that they be \""held to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> without the use of laces or buckles or fasteners . . .\"" in order to qualify for classification under subheading 6402.99.30, HTSUSA.  \r\rProtestant claims that examination of the subject shoe reveals that the laces purpose is not to cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, rather that the laces close the plastic/rubber straps around the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.\r\fConsequently, it is their belief that under the policy expressed in T.D. 93-88, the laces should not be included in determining the constituent material of the upper’s external surface.  In support thereof HQ 081305 dated March 10, 1988, is cited.  In that ruling Customs noted that an upper imported without laces is not considered to be an unfinished upper.  Moreover, the ruling went on to state that an upper imported with laces is considered two items for tariff purposes, i.e., and upper and laces.\r\rWe have reviewed HQ 081305 which dealt with among other things, whether shoelaces should be considered as part of the external surface area of the upper.   We disagree with protestant’s statement that under that ruling laces would never be part of the “external surface” of \r\r5\r\ra shoe.  The ruling deals with hi-top aerobic shoes which are very different from the sandals at issue here.  Laces on aerobic shoes clearly serve a principal function of keeping the shoe on the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  The laces on the sandal at issue are not only  functional (keeping the shoe on) but cover the skin when the shoe is worn and appear to be part of the design element of the shoe.  The ruling states, quite clearly, that “(s)hoe laces that do not cover the skin but only hold together the eyelet stays have never been considered part of the upper’s exterior surface.”  The ruling goes on to state that laces were not intended to be part of the uppers “external surface,” per se.\r\rIt is protestant’s belief that the purpose of the laces on the shoe in question is not to cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Protestant indicates that a Roman sandal is an example of a shoe in which the lace does cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  We note that the lace in both the Roman sandal and the shoe at issue here hold the sandal to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Without the laces you would have a sole/base of a sandal that has a number of strips attached to the base or sole of the shoe,  but not a wearable shoe [a Roman sandal has two strips through which the laces are drawn, the shoe here has ten].  In both cases the laces are visible, except where they crisscross each other, and in the shoe at issue, where they go through the eyelets.  Consequently, while TD 93-88 requires that laces not be included when “they do not cover the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> by themselves”, it is our view that in the instant case the lace actually covers part of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  Accordingly, TD 93-88 does not preclude the shoelaces from being included in the calculation of the external surface of the shoes at issue.  \r\rProtestant next argues that the laces should be excluded when analyzing the external surface of the shoe at issue as the laces are not firmly affixed to the base of the shoe.  The laces are easily removable, and therefore not integral to the exterior surface of the shoe.  Protestant states that the shoe can be imported as an upper with or without the laces.  It appears to be Protestant’s opinion that the laces are “loosely attached appurtenances” and are not part of the upper at all and not included in measuring the external surface area. \r\r\fThe courts consistently held under the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA), that attached appurtenances are excluded when measuring the external surface area of the upper because they provided only ornamental value and did not contribute to the utility of the uppers.  See. e.g. United States v. Castelazo & Associates A/C Stonewall Trading Company, 57 CCPA 16, C.A.D. 970 (1969), affirming 60 Cust. Ct. 650, C.D. 3486 (1968); where fur trimmed buttons attached to the uppers having merely ornamental value and no utility, they were not parts of the upper for tariff purposes.  T.D. 70\u001E238(19) dated October 15, 1970 (1970); HQ 051937 dated June 6, 1977; NY 807388 dated July 31, 1984.  As a result of these decisions, attached appurtenances were excluded from the measurement of the external surface area of the upper when they served only as an ornamental feature (see HQ 082661 dated October 17, 1988).  Moreover, this approach is consistent with HQ 081305 of March 10, 1988.\r\rIn further defining what constitutes the ESAU, the court, in Inter\u001E Pacific Corp. v. United States, 8 CIT 132 (1984), ruled that embroidery [ornamentation] permanently attached to a vinyl upper of a shoe is a part of the upper and also part of the ESAU.  Plaintiff, relying heavily on Castelazo, had argued that the embroidery sewn on the shoe upper should be excluded in \r\r6\r\rdetermining the composition of the exterior surface area of the upper since \""the embroidery has no utilitarian function nor does it add to the usefulness of the shoe.\"" \r\rInter\u001EPacific clearly held that whether an attachment to an upper is ornamental or functional is not relevant.  In defining ESAU, the court stated at page 139 the following: \r\rThe common meaning of the term exterior surface area is\rclear.  It is a sensory perception manifest as being the\routermost covering of a particular object without regard to\rthe functionality of the covering.  TSUS has effectively\rchanged the classification standard so that the judicial\rdistinction made between the upper and an ornament attached\rthereto is no longer of consequence.  Rather of import now\ris the manner in which something (whether ornamental or not)\ris attached to the upper.  If it is attached in such a way\rthat it covers the underlying plastic surface and a normal\rviewing disclosed that it constitutes at least part of the\rexterior surface area of the upper then that part\rconstituting the external surface area of the upper must be\rdeemed part of the upper and its composition must be\rincluded in arriving at the overall area of the upper. (Italics added) \r\rDecisions by the Customs Service and the courts interpreting nomenclature under the HTSUSA’ predecessor tariff code, the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), are not deemed dispositive under the HTSUSA.  However, \""... on a case\u001Eby\u001Ecase basis prior decisions should be considered instructive in interpreting the HTS, particularly where the nomenclature previously interpreted in those decisions remains unchanged and no dissimilar interpretation is required by the text of the HTS\"" (House Conf. Report 100\u001E576, April 20, 1988, pp. 549\u001E550, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. (1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1547, 1582\u001E1583).  In this case, the nomenclature controlling this case remains unchanged and no dissimilar interpretation is required by the text of the HTSUSA.  Accordingly, the tests set forth in Inter\u001EPacific apply to the merchandise at issue.  \r\r\fFollowing Inter\u001EPacific, the test for determining whether an appurtenance is part of an upper is whether it is visible and whether its removal would damage the shoe so as to render it unserviceable as footwear.  In the instant case the laces visibly cover a portion of the wearer’s <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>.  In addition, removal of the laces from the shoe at issue would clearly render the sandal unwearable and therefore unserviceable as footwear.  In view of the preceding discussion, we find that the laces form a portion of the ESAU.\r\rWe distinguish this from T.D. 84\u001E59, dated April 11, 1984, in which we set forth our position as to whether tongues should be included as ESAU.  It reads in pertinent part as follows:\r\r\r\r7\r\rIt has consistently been Customs position that the\rexterior surface area of the upper is whatever is\rvisible and tactile on the surface excepting such\rthings as buttons, strips and other loosely attached\rappurtenances.  In those cases where the tongue was\rheld not to be part of the exterior surface area of the\rupper, it was on a plane lower than a portion of the\rupper and was partially or wholly covered by laces and\reyelet facings or stays.\r\rThe laces are not on a lower plane than the rest of the upper, nor are they covered by stays or other laces, which might preclude inclusion as part of the ESAU.  Their functionality is not at issue.\r\rIn view of the foregoing, it is our position that style 7606 has an upper the ESAU of which is not over 90 percent rubber or plastics.

The samples will be returned to you, as requested.\r\rStyle 8108198 “Eastbay Women’s Tech Running Compression Capri Pant”, is a pair of capri-length pants composed of 80 percent polyester and 20 percent spandex jersey knit fabric.  The pull-on pants extend from the waist to the calf and feature a 1inch wide elasticized waistband, a small heat seal logo on upper left just below the waistband, a front inside drawstring closure, mesh panels down the sides of both legs from waist to the calf, refective bars at the top and bottom sides of both legs and under the back pocket, and  hemmed leg openings. \r\rStyle 8108193 “Eastbay Team Women’s 3” Compression Track Short”, is a pair of shorts composed of 80 percent polyester and 20 percent spandex jersey knit fabric.  The tight-fitting garment features a 1½ inch wide elasticized waistband, a small heat seal logo on upper left just below the waistband, a front inside drawstring closure, and hemmed leg openings. The pull-on shorts extend from the waist to the upper thigh area.\r\rStyle 8116909 “Eastbay Evapor™ Men’s Half Sleeve Compression Top”, is a men’s cut and sewn pullover composed of 84 percent polyester, 16 percent spandex, finely knit fabric that measures 35 stitches per two centimeters counted in the horizontal direction.\u00A0 Style 8116909 is of pieced construction and has a self-fabric crew neckline with a double neckband; three-quarter length, hemmed sleeves; flatlock stitching at the seams; a heat seal logo located at the bottom left side; and a straight, hemmed bottom. \r\rStyle 8116891 is a woman’s pullover composed of 84 percent polyester and 16 percent spandex knit fabric.

You state that the shoes will be valued at over $12.00 per pair.\r\r\tYou have submitted sample shoes identified as style # Y720 PRO12 “Magnete Exposure Low,” which does not cover the ankle and style # Y679 PRO12 “Magnete Exposure,” which covers the wearer’s ankle.  Both styles are variations on the classic lace-up sneaker with metal eyelets, canvas uppers and tongues, flexible rubber/plastic traction outer soles, foamed plastic cushioned insoles, foxing or foxing-like bands and rubber/plastic toe bumpers.  You state that since these shoes are marketed by you as casual <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> fashion shoes, they are not suitably constructed to provide cushioning for athletic activities and that they lack the added support more commonly found in athletic footwear.\r\r\tFor the purposes of footwear classified in Chapter 64, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, (HTSUS), the term “tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like” covers athletic footwear other than sports footwear, whether or not principally used for such athletic games or purposes.  While no specific construction feature is indicative of all athletic footwear, CBP considers features such as the flexibility of the sole (enabling the wearer to engage in activities requiring extensive running or fast footwork), foxing or foxing-like bands, weight, various means to secure the footwear to the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span>, athletic look and feel, among others, to determine athletic footwear classification.  We note that as you state in your letter, both the hi-top and low-top versions of your style name “Magnete Exposure” shoes are designed with many of the same characteristics usually found in the traditional canvas sneaker, that these shoes do have padded cushioning insoles and that they do exhibit sufficient athletic features to justify classification as tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like.\r\r\tTherefore, the applicable subheading for the two shoes, identified as style # Y720 PRO12 “Magnete Exposure Low” and style # Y679 PRO12 “Magnete Exposure,” will be 6404.11.9050, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for footwear with outer soles of rubber/plastics and uppers of textile material: Sports footwear; tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like: valued over $12/pair.

"{""text"":""\r\rHQ 963518\r\rJanuary 2, 2002\r\rCLA-2  RR:CR:TE  963518 SS\r\rCATEGORY:  Classification\r\rTARIFF NO.: 6115.12.1000, 6115.93.3000\r\rPort Director\rU. S. Customs Service\r700 Doug Davis Drive\rAtlanta, GA 30354\r\rRE:\tDecision on Application for Further Review of Protest 1704-99-100357; Classification of Graduated Compression Panty Hose and Stockings\r\rDear Port Director:\r\rThis is in response to the Application for Further Review of Protest Number 1704-99-100357 filed by the importer, Bauerfeind USA, Inc., contesting the classification of graduated compression panty hose and stockings which you forwarded to our office for review on November 22, 1999.  The Protestant disagrees with the decision of the port to liquidate the subject merchandise under subheadings 6115.12.2000, 6115.93.6010, and 6115.93.9020, HTSUSA, as other panty hose or stockings.  The Protestant claims that the merchandise was properly classified as entered under subheadings 6115.12.1000 and 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA, as surgical panty hose or stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\r\rThe Application for Further Review of Protest was timely filed and is proper pursuant to Part 174 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 174).\r\rFACTS:\r\rThe articles under protest are graduated compression panty hose and stockings.  The articles are made of synthetic fibers and the measurement per single yarn is 67 decitex or more.  The panty hose and stockings are of heavy gauge, opaque and elasticized knit fabric and are designed to supply graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg.\u0002 \r\rThe Protestant identifies the products at issue as part of the “Spa Hosiery Collection.”  Bauerfeind sells the collection to medical distributors who make these products available at medical supply stores.  The panty hose and stockings are available in three different fabric finishes: UltraSilk Sheers, SoftBasics and Champion Powersox.  The hosiery is available in a variety of styles: knee-highs, thigh-high short, thigh-high, waist/panty hose, and maternity panty hose.  \r\rThe panty hose and stockings at issue are principally obtained by prescription and are used for the treatment of venous diseases.  In order to obtain a proper fitting for these products, the patient must be measured by certified and well-trained personnel. \r\rThe port reclassified the articles as other panty hose and stockings based on the belief that a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg did not supply sufficient compression for orthopedic treatment and that the items were available without prescription. \r\rISSUE:\r\rWhat is the proper classification of graduated compression panty hose and stockings under the HTSUSA?\r\rLAW AND ANALYSIS:\r\rClassification of goods under the HTSUSA is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI).  GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.  Merchandise that cannot be classified in accordance with GRI 1 is to be classified in accordance with subsequent GRI taken in order.  The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN), constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level.  While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the EN provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings.\r\rIt is undisputed that these products are classified under heading 6115, HTSUSA, as “panty hose, tights, stockings, socks and other hosiery, including stockings for varicose veins, and footwear without applied soles, knitted or crocheted.”  It is also undisputed that the articles are “of synthetic fibers, measuring per single yarn 67 decitex or more.”  The only issue in this case is whether the items are considered surgical panty hose or stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment within the scope of subheadings 6115.12.1000 and 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA.\r\r\tUnder the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), surgical support stockings were classified as orthopedic appliances.  In Treasury Decision (T.D.) 76-133, Customs offered the following description of surgical stockings:\r\r\tFor tariff classification purposes, a surgical stocking is a leg and <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> covering which is made from a heavy gauge, opaque, elasticized fabric with either a one or two-way stretch, and which is worn as a remedial support of the leg.  It is designed for use in post-surgical support and in the treatment of thrombophlebitis, varicosities, edema, and other physical ailments, and is sold either singly or in pairs.  It is not the type of merchandise commonly known as support hose which can be purchased in a variety of retail stores.  Surgical stockings are usually obtained at the direction of a physician at certain medical supply outlets which have personnel specially trained to measure and fit the merchandise to the legs of each individual patient.\r\rThe instant products meet this general description of surgical stockings. \r\r\tWith the inception of the HTSUSA, heading 6115, HTSUSA, provided for stockings for varicose veins while heading 9021, HTSUSA, provided for orthopedic appliances.  In 1991, Customs distinguished between orthopedic appliances and stockings for varicose veins.  Customs held that stockings which supplied a compression range of 30-40 mm Hg, 40-50 mm Hg, or 50-60 mm Hg were classifiable as orthopedic appliances of heading 9021, HTSUSA.  See Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) 088272, dated March 1, 1992, and HQ 086146, dated March 14, 1991.  The articles were available by prescription only through medical and surgical supply outlets and a patient had to be measured and fitted by trained personnel to ensure a proper fit.  In describing the stockings as more than simply compression stockings for the treatment of varicose veins, Customs relied on the fact that they were prescribed by a physician for the treatment of serious venous diseases and other serious conditions such as reversible and irreversible lymphedema and severe post-thrombotic treatment.  While acknowledging the articles could be used for patients with varicose veins, Customs found that they were also used in large numbers for patients with post-operative swelling, including orthopedic patients.  Customs concluded that the articles acted to prevent the consequences of venous disease in that they prevented significant swelling and could be determined to prevent deformity in regard to venous ulcerations and dermatitis. \r\r\tIn 1992, the HTSUSA was amended to transfer surgical stockings and panty hose with graduated compression out of heading 9021, HTSUSA, to heading 6115, HTSUSA.  Special subheadings were created to specifically provide for surgical compression panty hose and stockings for orthopedic purposes.  For a detailed history of the transfer from heading 9021, HTSUSA, to heading 6115, HTSUSA, see HQ 959399, dated December 16, 1996.  Since that time, Customs has consistently limited the classification of surgical compression panty hose and stockings to items which have a minimum compression of  30 mm Hg.  HQ 959399, dated December 16, 1996; NY B87014, dated August 6, 1997; NY B81996, dated February 24, 1997; NY E82160, dated June 10, 1999; NY E82592; dated June 11, 1999; NY E82593, dated June 11, 1999; NY E82594, dated June 11, 1999; NY E82595, dated June 11, 1999; NY E82596, dated June 11, 1999; and NY F80388, dated December 28, 1999.  These rulings also indicate that Customs has generally  required that the articles be prescribed by a physician.  \r\r\tThe Protestant argues that panty hose or stockings with a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg are principally worn to prevent or correct bodily deformities and the consequences associated with venous disease and should be classified as surgical panty hose or stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  The Protestant asserts that although higher ranges may provide better results for certain conditions, 20 mm Hg is presently considered necessary for the treatment of venous disease.  Protestant also asserts that many physicians recommend 20-30 mm Hg of compression over higher compression ranges because patient compliance is much higher and symptom improvement is identical.  \r\rIn support of its arguments, Protestant offers a study which evaluates the effects of duration of use of class I (20-30 mm Hg) graduated compression hosiery following sclerotherapy.  See Robert Weiss, Neil Sadick, Mitchel Goldman, & Margaret Weiss, Post-Sclerotherapy Compression: Controlled Comparative Study of Duration of Compression and its Effects on Clinical Outcome  Dermatol Surg, 35: 105-108 (1999).  Most importantly, the study establishes that  “[c]ompression greater than 20 mm Hg is presently considered necessary for reduction of venous insufficiency.”  The study makes certain important statements including “. . . in terms of controlling objective and subjective parameters of venous insufficiency no difference was found between class I (20-30 mm Hg) and class II (30-40 mm Hg) compression stockings.”  The study also suggests that sclerotherapy results overall can be significantly improved by class I compression and should be part of the post-operative sclerotherapy protocol.  In citing other studies, the study concludes that class I (20-30 mm Hg) compression may be recommended over class II since patient compliance is much higher and symptom improvement is identical.  See Jungbeck C, Thulin I, Darenheim C, Norgen L.  Graduated Compression Treatment in Patients with Chronic Venous Insufficiency; A Study Comparing Low and Medium Grade Compression Stockings.  Phlebologie, 12:142-5 (1997). \r\rProtestant also offered several letters from vascular surgeons and dermatologists familiar with the beneficial effects of compression on the venous.  The letters indicate agreement within the medical community that surgical stockings with graduated compression of 20-30 mm Hg are principally used for orthopedic purposes and are primarily prescribed by physicians to prevent or correct bodily deformities and the consequences associated with venous disease.  The letters support Protestant’s claim that it is widely recognized that 20 mm Hg of compression is considered necessary for the treatment of venous disease.  The physicians state that they recommend using surgical supports with graduated compression of 20 to 30 mm Hg to prevent telangiectatic matting following sclerotherapy, to prevent thrombus formation and phlebitic reactions following sclerotherapy, to reduce post-operative edema, to prevent venous ulcerations, to prevent venous dermatitis and as treatment protocol for post-operative invasive vascular procedures.  \r\rThe letters from the medical authorities also confirm that a patient must be measured by certified and well-trained personnel in order to obtain a proper fit for the stockings.  The doctors suggest that patients generally find the hosiery uncomfortable and do not <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">wear</span> them unless directed by a physician.  Lastly, the letters advise that surgical stockings are significantly more expensive than support hosiery of the types generally found in retail stores.  \r\rIndependent research by this office also confirms the Protestant’s claims.  Physicians recommend graduated compression therapy as a treatment for venous insufficiency.\u0002  Graduated compression hosiery is generally available in three classes of compression; class I specifically covers a compression range of 20-30 mm Hg.  Compression stockings are generally prescribed by a physician.  The pharmacy or medical supply staff will take measurements of various parts of the <span class=\""highlighted-text\"">foot</span> and leg in order to fit the stocking and prefer that a patient have a prescription which prescribes the amount of compression.  Stockings obtained by prescription are often covered by insurance.  Graduated compression stockings are significantly more expensive than support hosiery of the types generally found in retail stores.   The items at issue are sold at the following approximate prices (and the prices are representative of similar products by other manufacturers): \r\rItem\t\t\t\t\tPrice\rpanty hose \t\t\t\t$75.00 to $100.00 each\rthigh-high\t\t\t\t$60.00 to $95.00 per pair\rknee-highs or socks \t\t$45.00 to $65.00 per pair\r\rCustoms finds that the Protestant has presented credible medical evidence that surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression ranging from 20-30 mm Hg should be considered surgical panty hosiery with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment when they are primarily prescribed by a physician and are specially fitted to the patient by certified well-trained personnel.  Based on information provided to this office by qualified members of the medical profession and independent research, we believe the instant hosiery is within the scope of the subheadings providing for surgical panty hose and stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.\r\rTo the extent that this ruling conflicts with previous rulings on surgical stockings supplying compression in the range of 20-30 mm Hg, please be advised that those rulings are under review to determine whether they should be the subject of a proposed notice of modification.\r\rHOLDING:\r\rBased on the foregoing, the panty hose are classifiable under subheading 6115.12.1000, HTSUSA, which is the provision for surgical panty hose with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  The applicable rate of duty was1.2 percent ad valorem in1998 and “Free” in 1999.\r\rThe stockings are classifiable under subheading 6115.93.3000, HTSUSA, which is the provision for surgical stockings with graduated compression for orthopedic treatment.  The applicable rate of duty was 2.3 percent ad valorem in 1998 and “Free” in 1999.  \r\rThe protest should be ALLOWED.  In accordance with Section 3A(11)(b) of Customs Directive 099 3550-065, dated August 4, 1993, Subject: Revised Protest Directive, you are to mail this decision, together with the Customs Form 19, to the protestant no later than 60 days from the date of this letter.
